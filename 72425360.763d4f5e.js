After a player receives a ",Object(n.a)("em",{parentName:"li"},"Fix Clue")," in such a situation, they should assume that the ",Object(n.a)("em",{parentName:"li"},"Finesse"),' is "still on". So, depending on the situation, they should either know that the initial card that was clued is playable (like in an ',Object(n.a)("em",{parentName:"li"},"Out-of-Order Finesse"),") or continue to blind-play cards to fulfill the initial ",Object(n.a)("em",{parentName:"li"},"Finesse")," (if the card clued with a ",Object(n.a)("em",{parentName:"li"},"Fix Clue")," seems to be unrelated)."),Object(n.a)("li",{parentName:"ul"},"Importantly, ",Object(n.a)("em",{parentName:"li"},"Finesses")," with a ",Object(n.a)("em",{parentName:"li"},"Lie Component")," are ",Object(n.a)("strong",{parentName:"li"},"only"),' allowed if there is not an alternative line that would "get" the same number of cards without any lies. Thus, if you are looking to do a ',Object(n.a)("em",{parentName:"li"},"Finesse")," with a ",Object(n.a)("em",{parentName:"li"},"Lie Component"),", make sure you carefully consider the efficiency of all of the possible alternatives.")))}h.isMDXComponent=!0},167:function(e,a,t){"use strict";t.d(a,"a",(function(){return u}));var l=t(0),i=t.n(l);function n(e,a,t){return a in e?Object.defineProperty(e,a,{value:t,enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0}):e[a]=t,e}function r(e,a){var t=Object.keys(e);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var l=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);a&&(l=l.filter((function(a){return Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(e,a).enumerable}))),t.push.apply(t,l)}return t}function s(e){for(var a=1;a<arguments.length;a++){var t=null!=arguments[a]?arguments[a]:{};a%2?r(Object(t),!0).forEach((function(a){n(e,a,t[a])})):Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors?Object.defineProperties(e,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(t)):r(Object(t)).forEach((function(a){Object.defineProperty(e,a,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(t,a))}))}return e}function o(e,a){if(null==e)return{};var t,l,i=function(e,a){if(null==e)return{};var t,l,i={},n=Object.keys(e);for(l=0;l<n.length;l++)t=n[l],a.indexOf(t)>=0||(i[t]=e[t]);return i}(e,a);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var n=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);for(l=0;l<n.length;l++)t=n[l],a.indexOf(t)>=0||Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(e,t)&&(i[t]=e[t])}return i}var c=i.a.createContext({}),h=function(e){var a=i.a.useContext(c),t=a;return e&&(t="function"==typeof e?e(a):s(s({},a),e)),t},m={inlineCode:"code",wrapper:function(e){var a=e.children;return i.a.createElement(i.a.Fragment,{},a)}},p=i.a.forwardRef((function(e,a){var t=e.components,l=e.mdxType,n=e.originalType,r=e.parentName,c=o(e,["components","mdxType","originalType","parentName"]),p=h(t),u=l,b=p["".concat(r,".").concat(u)]||p[u]||m[u]||n;return t?i.a.createElement(b,s(s({ref:a},c),{},{components:t})):i.a.createElement(b,s({ref:a},c))}));function u(e,a){var t=arguments,l=a&&a.mdxType;if("string"==typeof e||l){var n=t.length,r=new Array(n);r[0]=p;var s={};for(var o in a)hasOwnProperty.call(a,o)&&(s[o]=a[o]);s.originalType=e,s.mdxType="string"==typeof e?e:l,r[1]=s;for(var c=2;c<n;c++)r[c]=t[c];return i.a.createElement.apply(null,r)}return i.a.createElement.apply(null,t)}p.displayName="MDXCreateElement"}}]);
