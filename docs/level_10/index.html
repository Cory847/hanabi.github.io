to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>Sometimes, players will figure out asymmetric information about the identities of cards in their hand.</li><li>For example, in a 3-player game:<ul><li>It is the <em>Early Game</em> and there are 3 clues available.</li><li>Alice discards, initiating the <em>Mid-Game</em>.</li><li>Bob knows that there must be nothing left to clue, or Alice would have been obligated to clue it.</li><li>Bob has three 2&#x27;s in his hand that were saved with a <em>2 Save</em> clue earlier on.</li><li>Bob sees that Cathy has a red 2 on chop. Since Alice did not clue it, Bob must have the other copy in his hand.</li><li>Bob has not discarded since the <em>2 Save</em> was given to him earlier on. Thus, he knows that one of his three clued 2&#x27;s must be the other copy of the red 2, so he marks all three cards as &quot;possible red 2&quot;.</li><li>However, these notes are asymmetric - Alice and Bob write the notes, but Cathy does not. (Cathy has no idea that this is happening because Cathy cannot see her own red 2 on chop.)</li><li>Alice and Bob will have to keep this information desync in mind going forward.</li></ul></li><li>By default, players should never assume that other players have asymmetric information. This is because having asymmetric information is the <strong>exception</strong>, rather than the norm.</li><li>In the previous example, Bob might perform an action later on in the game that seems to demonstrate that he knows he has the red 2. But Cathy should not assume that he does, unless there is <strong>no other explanation</strong> for the clue.</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="duplication-responsibility"></a>Duplication Responsibility<a class="hash-link" href="#duplication-responsibility" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>Usually, if a 2 needs to be saved, it is not the responsibility of a player with already-clued 2&#x27;s in his hand, because they could potentially violate <em>Good Touch Principle</em> by cluing it. So, they should defer and let someone else on the team do it. (The same general concept also applies to cluing playable cards on chop, for example.)</li><li>However, if all players have a clued 2 in their hand, then someone has to take a risk of violating <em>Good Touch Principle</em> in order to satisfy <em>Save Principle</em>. Who should do it?</li><li>In this situation, the player who has the least number of matching clued cards should take responsibility. If 2+ players are tied, then the player with the less specific type of clue on their card(s) should take responsibility.</li><li>If 2+ players have the exact same number of clued cards and type of clued cards, then either player should save the card.</li><li>Example 1:<ul><li>In a 3 player game, Alice has a blue 2 on chop that needs to be saved.</li><li>Bob has 2 unknown 2&#x27;s.</li><li>Cathy has 1 unknown 2.</li><li>Bob should let Cathy perform the save, since 1 matching card is less than 2 matching cards.</li></ul></li><li>Example 2:<ul><li>In a 3 player game, Alice has a blue 2 on chop that needs to be saved.</li><li>Bob has 2 unknown 2&#x27;s.</li><li>Cathy has 2 unknown 2&#x27;s.</li><li>The responsibility is shared, so Bob should perform the clue if Cathy has a good discard, or he can discard and let Cathy do it.</li></ul></li><li>Example 3:<ul><li>In a 3 player game, Alice has a blue 2 on chop that needs to be saved.</li><li>Bob has 2 unknown blue cards.</li><li>Cathy has 1 unknown 2&#x27;s.</li><li>Bob should let Cathy perform the save, since 1 matching card is less than 2 matching cards.</li></ul></li><li>Example 4:<ul><li>In a 3 player game, Alice has a blue 2 on chop that needs to be saved.</li><li>Bob has 2 unknown blue cards. No blue cards have been played yet, so from Bob&#x27;s perspective, each blue card has a 1/5 chance of being the blue 2.</li><li>Cathy has 2 unknown 2&#x27;s. No 2&#x27;s have been played yet, so from Cathy&#x27;s perspective, each 2 has a 1/5 chance of being the blue 2.</li><li>The responsibility is shared, so Bob should perform the clue if Cathy has a good discard, or he can discard and let Cathy do it.</li></ul></li><li>Example 5:<ul><li>In a 3 player game, Alice has a blue 2 on chop that needs to be saved.</li><li>Bob has 2 unknown blue cards. No blue cards have been played yet, so from Bob&#x27;s perspective, each blue card has a 1/5 chance of being the blue 2.</li><li>Cathy has 2 unknown 2&#x27;s. One 2 has been played already, so from Cathy&#x27;s perspective, each 2 has a 1/4 chance of being the blue 2.</li><li>Thus, it is Bob&#x27;s responsibility to save the blue 2.</li></ul></li></ul><br><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="special-moves"></a>Special Moves<a class="hash-link" href="#special-moves" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="context-clues--the-stale-1s-clue"></a>Context Clues &amp; The Stale 1&#x27;s Clue<a class="hash-link" href="#context-clues--the-stale-1s-clue" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>We have many conventions that specify what a clue means. But combined with this, we are always expected to look at the context of the game.</li><li>For example, sometimes players will receive a clue that just feels strange. If this good clue could have been given a bunch of turns ago, why is it only being given now? Were the other players not paying close enough attention, and are only getting around to cluing this card now?</li><li>In these types of situations, from <em>High Value Principle</em>, you can assume that the team is not making any mistakes, which means that the meaning of the clue should be altered from the &quot;textbook&quot; definition. We call these types of clues <em>Context Clues</em> because they rely on contextual reading of the game state.</li><li>The most common <em>Context Clue</em> is given to &quot;stale&quot; 1&#x27;s towards the beginning of the game. For example, in a 3-player game:<ul><li>After a few ordinary clues happen, Alice discards, which ends the <em>Early Game</em> and initiates the <em>Mid-Game</em>. By doing this, she implies that there is nothing to do (because players are mandated to &quot;extinguish&quot; all of the available <em>Play Clues</em> and <em>Save Clues</em> in the <em>Early Game</em>).</li><li>Bob then immediately clues Cathy about two 1&#x27;s.</li><li>Normally, from <em>Good Touch Principle</em>, Cathy would assume that both of the 1&#x27;s were &quot;good&quot; and play both.</li><li>However, Cathy also knows that if both of these 1&#x27;s were good, then Alice was required to clue them before discarding.</li><li>Thus, Cathy can reason that one of the 1&#x27;s are bad. Furthermore, by convention, she knows that the oldest (right-most) 1 is bad, because that would be the one that she would ordinarily play first.</li><li>So, Cathy should skip over the oldest (right-most) 1, and play the other 1. Cathy should also treat the other 1 as known-trash.</li></ul></li><li>The <em>Stale 1&#x27;s Clue</em> is specific example of a more general concept called <em>Focus Inversion</em>, which is covered below.</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="focus-inversion"></a>Focus Inversion<a class="hash-link" href="#focus-inversion" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>Sometimes, a <em>Play Clue</em> is given that both touches the chop card and one or more other card. The normal interpretation of this is to treat it as a chop-focus <em>Play Clue</em>, and play the chop. However, sometimes a player can know that the chop is not actually playable. This can be determined through:<ul><li>explicit information - negative clues present on the card</li><li>implicit information - historical / contextual information about the card derived from moves that teammates performed earlier on in the game</li></ul></li><li>When this occurs, the clue is meant to be a <em>Play Clue</em> on the left-most card <strong>instead</strong> of the chop card.</li><li>Just like a &quot;normal&quot; <em>Play Clue</em> that touches multiple new cards, the chop card (and other new cards introduced) are not necessarily playable right now.</li><li>For example, in a 3-player game:<ul><li>Alice clues 1&#x27;s to Bob, which introduces one card on slot 1.</li><li>Bob plays the 1 and it is red 1.</li><li>Cathy clues blue to Bob, which introduces two cards on slot 1 and slot 5.</li><li>Normally, Bob would think that this is a <em>Chop-Focus</em> clue, and play the blue 1 from slot 5.</li><li>However, his slot 5 card has a negative 1 clue on it (from Alice&#x27;s number 1 clue), so it explicitly cannot be the blue 1.</li><li>Thus, this must be <em>Focus Inversion</em> and blue 1 must be on slot 1. The blue card on slot 5 can be either blue 2, blue 3, blue 4, or blue 5.</li></ul></li><li>Note that <strong><em>Self-Finesses</em> with rank always take precedence over <em>Focus Inversion</em></strong>. (<em>Self-Finesses</em> with rank are quite common, but <em>Self Finesses</em> with color are nonsensical.)</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-positional-discard-indicating-a-play-with-a-discard"></a>The Positional Discard (Indicating a Play with a Discard)<a class="hash-link" href="#the-positional-discard-indicating-a-play-with-a-discard" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>Near the end of the game, if you have no clues left and no cards to play, you can transmit information based on which card you discard.</li><li>Thus, you can discard the slot in your hand that matches the slot in someone else&#x27;s hand that they are supposed to play.</li><li>Usually, players will only do this if they can see all of the remaining useful cards. Since they see everything, they know that they cannot be discarding anything important.</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-positional-misplay-indicating-a-play-with-a-misplay"></a>The Positional Misplay (Indicating a Play with a Misplay)<a class="hash-link" href="#the-positional-misplay-indicating-a-play-with-a-misplay" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>On the final round of the game, if a player has no cards in their hand to play, a <em>Positional Discard</em> from <strong>any</strong> slot will work, because it is globally known that every card is visible.</li><li>However, sometimes <em>Positional Discards</em> are done before the final round while there are still some cards left in the deck. In this situation, if a player discarded their chop card as a <em>Positional Discard</em>, this would not work, because discarding chop is the normal action that the rest of the team is expecting.</li><li>Thus, in order to more strongly communicate the &quot;play this slot&quot; message, they can instead misplay their chop card. Since the rest of the team can see that the card misplayed for &quot;no reason&quot;, they can deduce that it was a <em>Positional Misplay</em>.</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-double-positional-misplay-indicating-two-plays-with-a-misplay"></a>The Double Positional Misplay (Indicating Two Plays with a Misplay)<a class="hash-link" href="#the-double-positional-misplay-indicating-two-plays-with-a-misplay" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>Normally, the <em>Positional Misplay</em> is only used as a last-resort when a <em>Positional Discard</em> would not work. But what if a player does a <em>Positional Misplay</em> when a normal <em>Positional Discard</em> would have gotten the job done?</li><li><em>Positional Discards</em> and <em>Positional Misplays</em> promise that only one card in the specified slot is playable. So, if there are <strong>two</strong> people with a play on the same slot, then it will be ambiguous, because each of them will think that the other person is supposed to play.</li><li>Thus, a <em>Positional Misplay</em> that is unnecessary transforms into a <em>Double Positional Misplay</em>, indicating to the team that <strong>two</strong> cards on that exact slot are playable.</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-trash-order-chop-move"></a>The Trash Order Chop Move<a class="hash-link" href="#the-trash-order-chop-move" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>Sometimes, a player will have two known trash cards in their hand (and these cards are explicitly known trash, meaning that everyone on the team can equally see that they are known trash).</li><li>In this situation, the player is expected to discard the newest (left-most) trash card.</li><li>Thus, if a player skips over their newest trash card and instead discards the second newest trash card, they must be trying to communicate something extra.</li><li>This means that the next player should <em>Chop Move</em> (in a manner similar to a <em>Order Chop Move</em>).</li><li>Note that a player is not necessarily trying to perform a <em>Trash Order Chop Move</em> if the two trash cards have different kinds of clues on them. For example, by discarding specific trash cards, it can communicate that the player &quot;sees&quot; all of the non-trash possibilities of that card.</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-misplay-chop-move"></a>The Misplay Chop Move<a class="hash-link" href="#the-misplay-chop-move" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>Sometimes, a desirable card is on the next player&#x27;s chop and it is not directly cluable. In this situation, players can cleverly use the various kinds of chop moves in order to save the card (e.g. <em>Trash Chop Move</em>, <em>5&#x27;s Chop Move</em>, <em>Tempo Clue Chop Move</em>, and so forth).</li><li>However, none of these chop moves may be available to perform. In such a situation, players can <em>Chop Move</em> a player by giving them a clue to make them intentionally misplay the clued card. This works in exactly the same way as a <em>Trash Chop Move</em>, except that it the trash is not known to the player receiving the clue (and it costs the team a strike).</li><li>For example, in a 3-player game:<ul><li>All of the 2&#x27;s are played on the stacks.</li><li>Bob&#x27;s hand is completely unclued.</li><li>Alice clues Bob red, touching one card on slot 1 as a <em>Play Clue</em>.</li><li>Bob assumes that it is a red 3 and immediately plays the card. However, it is actually a red 4 and misplays.</li><li>Bob knows that if Alice is not making a mistake, then she must be trying to communicate something special. Similar to a <em>Trash Chop Move</em>, Bob can reason that multiple cards in his hand are important. He marks slot 2, slot 3, slot 4, and slot 5 as being <em>Chop Moved</em>.</li></ul></li><li>The <em>Misplay Chop Move</em> is the most costly type of chop move, so it should only be performed in a situation where no other kind of <em>Chop Move</em> would work.</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-fake-save"></a>The Fake Save<a class="hash-link" href="#the-fake-save" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>We are only allowed to perform <em>Save Clues</em> on specific cards and in specific ways, as outlined in <a href="/docs/level_1#save-clues">level 1</a>. For example, we all agree that we must save 5&#x27;s with number 5.</li><li>In some specific circumstances, the team will have only one clue available and multiple cards must be saved with a single clue. In this situation, to prevent losing the game (or losing a currently-playable card), it is permissible to <em>Lie</em> to the next player and perform a <em>Fake Save</em> (e.g. a non-legal <em>Save Clue</em>).</li><li>After a <em>Fake Save</em>, the player receiving the clue will mark their chop card as something other than what it really is. Thus, this move commits the team to giving a <em>Fix Clue</em> to repair the <em>Lie</em> at some point in the future.</li><li>For example, in a 3-player game:<ul><li>Alice has 1 clue available.</li><li>Bob has a red 5 on chop, followed by a red 4. The other copy of the red 4 is in the discard pile, so there are two critical cards in a row.</li><li>Alice is not allowed to save the red 5 with a red clue, because then it would look like a <em>Save Clue</em> on a red 4.</li><li>However, if Alice clues number 5 to Bob, then he will discard the red 4.</li><li>Thus, Alice performs a <em>Fake Save</em> on both red cards by cluing red.</li><li>Bob will mark his chop as the red 4, so the team will have to give him a number 5 clue as a <em>Fix Clue</em> at some point in the future. At that point, Bob will be surprised, but he will be able to retroactively see that Alice was in a very tight spot and had to give a <em>Fake Save</em>.</li></ul></li><li><em>Fake Saves</em> are <strong>only allowed as a last resort</strong>. If there is some other line that would &quot;work&quot;, then players must use the other line. Because of this, <em>Fake Saves</em> are extremely rare.</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-distribution-clue"></a>The Distribution Clue<a class="hash-link" href="#the-distribution-clue" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>In the <em>End-Game</em>, when a player has many playable cards, there is the risk that they will not be able to play all cards before the end of the game.</li><li>Thus, it might make sense to spend a clue to duplicate one of their playable cards in someone else&#x27;s hand. This would violate <em>Good Touch Principle</em>, but it would relieve the player with the loaded hand from some of the card-playing burden.</li><li>Since it distributes plays more evenly throughout the team, this is called a <em>Distribution Clue</em>. <em>Distribution Clues</em> better satisfy <em>Team Distribution Principle</em>.</li></ul><br><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="general-principles"></a>General Principles<a class="hash-link" href="#general-principles" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="cluing-1s-in-the-early-game"></a>Cluing 1&#x27;s in the Early Game<a class="hash-link" href="#cluing-1s-in-the-early-game" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li>As outlined in the <a href="/docs/level_3#tempo">level 3 strategy section</a>, Hanabi is about balancing <em>Efficiency</em> and <em>Tempo</em>.</li><li>As outlined in the <a href="/docs/level_6#the-value-of-one-away-from-playable-cards">level 6 strategy section</a>, <em>one-away-from-playable</em> cards are valuable.</li><li>So, players have to balance <em>Efficiency</em>, <em>Tempo</em>, and &quot;locking in&quot; a touch on <em>one-away-from-playable</em> cards.</li><li>In the <em>Early Game</em>, it is very common for players to give a number 1 clue when they see a hand that has two or more 1&#x27;s in it. And this type of clue is normally pretty good. But because of the previous considerations, sometimes it would be better to get the 1&#x27;s with several color clues instead.</li></ul><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="example-1"></a>Example 1<a class="hash-link" href="#example-1" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><ul><li>Players should not just consider how good their individual clue is - they should also consider how their teammates can <strong>build</strong> on top of their clue.</li><li>For example, in a 3-player game:<ul><li>It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.</li><li>Bob&#x27;s hand is as follows, from newest to oldest: <code>green 4, red 1, red 3, blue 2, blue 1</code></li><li>Alice would like to get the red 1 and the blue 1 played from Bob&#x27;s hand. (No-one else has a red 1 or a blue 1.) Should Alice clue number 1, red, or blue?</li><li>If Alice clues number 1, it would be a 2-for-1 clue. But then the team will probably spend a clue getting the blue 2. This will result in an efficiency of 3-for-2. And the red 3 will probably end up being discarded. Bad.</li><li>If Alice clues blue, it would be a 2-for-1 clue. But then the team will no longer be able to give a red clue, because it would be <em>Chop-Focused</em> on the red 3. So they would have to clue number 1, which would result in an efficiency of 3-for-2. Bad.</li><li>Thus, Alice should clue red first, and then clue blue later, resulting in an efficiency of 4-for-2.</li></ul></li></ul><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="example-2"></a>Example 2<a class="hash-link" href="#example-2" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><ul><li>When players make the choice between cluing number 1 or cluing color, the cards in other people&#x27;s hands should also be considered.</li><li>For example, in a 4-player game:<ul><li>It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.</li><li>Cathy&#x27;s hand is as follows, from newest to oldest: <code>red 1, green 4, blue 3, blue 1</code></li><li>Donald is holding a cluable red 2.</li><li>Alice would like to get the red 1 and the blue 1 played. (No-one else has a red 1 or a blue 1.) Should she clue 1, red, or blue?</li><li>Just like in the previous example, cluing number 1 means that the red 2 will have to be clued as a 1-for-1, which results in an efficiency of 3-for-2.</li><li>Instead, Alice clues red to Donald, performing the <em>Finesse</em> as a 2-for-1. Next, Bob clues blues to Cathy as a 2-for-1. In total, this is a 4-for-2.</li></ul></li></ul><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="example-3"></a>Example 3<a class="hash-link" href="#example-3" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><ul><li>As explained in the <a href="/docs/beginner#other-general-strategy">beginner&#x27;s guide</a>, it is almost always better to give a <em>Play Clue</em> instead of a <em>Save Clue</em> if a player has a playable card in their hand.</li><li>However, building on the theme of having teammates &quot;build&quot; on your clues, sometimes it is better to give a <em>Save Clue</em> first and then a <em>Play Clue</em> later.</li><li>For example, in a 3-player game:<ul><li>It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.</li><li>Cathy&#x27;s hand is as follows, from newest to oldest: <code>blue 4, blue 4, red 3, red 1, blue 5</code></li><li>Alice would like to get the red 1 played. (No-one else has a red 1 in their hand.) Alice also knows that the team needs to eventually save the red 5.</li><li>If Alice clues number 1 first to get the red 1, then the team will need to give a <em>5 Save</em> to save the blue 5, resulting in an efficiency of 2-for-2.</li><li>Instead, Alice clues number 5 as a <em>5 Save</em>, which allows Bob to follow up with a red <em>Chop-Focus Play Clue</em>.

If so, maybe a color clue is better.</li><li>Does giving a number 1 clue give the player the ability to perform a useful <em>Order Chop Move</em>? If so, maybe a number 1 clue is better.</li><li>Are there other ways to touch the extra cards from a color clue? If so, maybe a number 1 clue is better.</li></ul></li></ul></div></article><div class="margin-vert--xl"><div class="row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/hanabi/hanabi.github.io/edit/main/docs/level_10.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="1.2em" width="1.2em" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet" role="img" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2LL7"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div></div></div><div class="margin-vert--lg"><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/docs/level_9"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Â« Level 9 - Bluffs</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/docs/level_11"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Level 11 - Intermediate Bluffs Â»</div></a></div></nav></div></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_2xL- thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#conventions" class="table-of-contents__link">Conventions</a><ul><li><a href="#assuming-asymmetric-information" class="table-of-contents__link">Assuming Asymmetric Information</a></li><li><a href="#duplication-responsibility" class="table-of-contents__link">Duplication Responsibility</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#special-moves" class="table-of-contents__link">Special Moves</a><ul><li><a href="#context-clues--the-stale-1s-clue" class="table-of-contents__link">Context Clues &amp; The Stale 1&#39;s Clue</a></li><li><a href="#focus-inversion" class="table-of-contents__link">Focus Inversion</a></li><li><a href="#the-positional-discard-indicating-a-play-with-a-discard" class="table-of-contents__link">The Positional Discard (Indicating a Play with a Discard)</a></li><li><a href="#the-positional-misplay-indicating-a-play-with-a-misplay" class="table-of-contents__link">The Positional Misplay (Indicating a Play with a Misplay)</a></li><li><a href="#the-double-positional-misplay-indicating-two-plays-with-a-misplay" class="table-of-contents__link">The Double Positional Misplay (Indicating Two Plays with a Misplay)</a></li><li><a href="#the-trash-order-chop-move" class="table-of-contents__link">The Trash Order Chop Move</a></li><li><a href="#the-misplay-chop-move" class="table-of-contents__link">The Misplay Chop Move</a></li><li><a href="#the-fake-save" class="table-of-contents__link">The Fake Save</a></li><li><a href="#the-distribution-clue" class="table-of-contents__link">The Distribution Clue</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#general-principles" class="table-of-contents__link">General Principles</a><ul><li><a href="#cluing-1s-in-the-early-game" class="table-of-contents__link">Cluing 1&#39;s in the Early Game</a></li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Built with <a href="https://v2.docusaurus.io/">Docusaurus</a>.</div></div></div></footer></div>
