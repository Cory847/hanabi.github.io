So, piper blind-plays his Finesse Position card (as a 5 Pull Double Finesse). It is a rainbow 1 and it successfully plays.IAMJEFF is expecting this clue to be a 5 Number Discharge and he is surprised that piper blind-plays his slot 1 instead of his slot 3.

Something special must be going on, since a 3 Bluff would never cause two people to blind-play in a row.Subsequently, RaKXeR knows that this must be a Bad Touch Double Bluff, since two unrelated cards blind-played in a row.

"},{"title":"Single Card Focus","type":1,"pageTitle":"Beginner's Guide","url":"docs/beginner#single-card-focus","content":"In some Hanabi groups, when a bunch of cards are clued, there is no consistent definition of what you should do.In our group, we don't want there to be any guesswork - we all agree on a system that specifies exactly what a clue means so that everyone is always on the same page. The System# If two or more cards are touched, then the clue is only focused on a single card. (Meaning that it is either a Play Clue or a Save Clue on the focused card only.)Nothing is implied about the non-focused cards (beyond that they will be useful at some point later on).So, how do you know which card is focused? The focus is always on the card that did not have any clues on it already. (We refer to this as the \"brand new card introduced\".)If there are multiple \"new\" cards, then: If the chop card is a \"new\" card, then the focus is on the chop.Otherwise, the focus is on the left-most card. Example 1 - A Basic Clue#  If only one card is touched by a clue, then the clue is (obviously) talking about that one card.In the above screenshot, Alice clues blue to Bob.Thus, the focus of the clue is blue 1. This is a Play Clue on blue 1. Example 2 - Left-most Focus#  In the above screenshot, Alice clues blue to Bob.Before this clue, Bob's hand was completely unclued. So, with this clue, two new cards were introduced - the blue card on slot 2 and the blue card on slot 4.Bob knows that in this situation, the focus of the clue is the left-most of the two new cards. Thus, similar to the last example, this is a Play Clue on blue 1.Since the other blue card in his hand must be useful, Bob can reason that it is either blue 2, blue 3, blue 4, or blue 5. He will hold on to the card for later. Example 3 - Chop Focus#  In the above screenshot, Alice clues purple to Bob (on the first turn of the game).Before this clue, Bob's hand was completely unclued. So, with this clue, three new cards were introduced - slot 1, slot 2, and slot 5.Before this clue, Bob's chop was slot 5. So, since the clue touched his chop and Chop Focus has priority, this must be a Chop Focus Play Clue on purple 1. Bob should play the slot 5 card as purple 1.  "},{"title":"Play Clues & Save Clues","type":1,"pageTitle":"Beginner's Guide","url":"docs/beginner#play-clues--save-clues","content":"A clue can either be: a Save Clue (meaning to save the focused card for later)a Play Clue (meaning to play the focused card) Let's go through each in turn.  "},{"title":"Save Clues","type":1,"pageTitle":"Beginner's Guide","url":"docs/beginner#save-clues","content":"Save Clues can only be given to cards on chop. You can't give a Save Clue otherwise! So if a clue is focused on a card that is not on the chop, it must be a Play Clue. The team must save the following cards (and are only allowed to save the following cards): All 5'sUnique 2's (meaning that only one copy is currently visible)Critical cards (meaning that the other copy is discarded) Sometimes, a Chop Focus clue could be either a Save Clue or a Play Clue. When this happens, the receiving player must consider both possibilities and hold on to the card until they know for sure.The three kinds of Save Clues are listed below. The 5 Save#  Since there is only one copy of each 5, all of the 5's need to be saved so that they won't be discarded.In the above screenshot: Alice clues Bob number 5, which touches a single 5 on slot 5.Before this clue, Bob did not have any clued cards in his hand.Since the clue was focused on his chop, Bob knows that this must be a 5 Save on the 5. It can be any 5 in the game. 5's must be saved with a number clue instead of a color clue. (Otherwise, it will look like a Play Clue!) The 2 Save#  Even though there are two copies of each 2, we agree that they are so important that we must save them in a manner similar to 5's.In the above screenshot: Alice clues Bob number 2, which touches a 2 on slot 3 and slot 5.Before this clue, Bob did not have any clued cards in his hand.Since the clue was focused on his chop, Bob knows that this must be a 2 Save on the 2. It can be any 2 in the game. Similar to 5's, 2's must be saved with a number clue instead of a color clue.You can think of the 2 Save as a last resort to save a 2. Thus, players are not allowed to perform a 2 Save on a 2 if that same 2 is visible in someone else's hand (because the team does not actually need to save that 2 quite yet - they can 2 Save it when the other copy reaches the chop). The Critical Save#  For the same reason that 5's need to be saved, critical cards also need to be saved. (Critical cards are defined as cards that have the other copy discarded.)Players can choose to save critical cards with either a color clue or a number clue. Note that this even applies to 2's in the rare case that a copy of that 2 ends up in the discard pile. In the above screenshot: The current discard pile is shown to the right of the hands.Alice clues Bob yellow, which touches a card on slot 4.Before this clue, the only clued card in Bob's hand was the 5 on slot 5.This could be a Play Clue on the yellow 2. However, since the clue was focused on his chop, this could also be a Save Clue.Bob looks through the discard pile and finds that there is a yellow 4 there. Thus, this could be a Save Clue on the yellow 4. So, Bob knows that for now, he has to hold on to the card.Bob marks the card as either a yellow 2 or a yellow 4, so that he can keep track of it for later. Then, he discards.  "},{"title":"Play Clues","type":1,"pageTitle":"Beginner's Guide","url":"docs/beginner#play-clues","content":"We are very strict with what we clue - we don't just randomly clue cards in the hand.So if a card is touched as the focus of the clue and it is not on chop, then that card must be playable!Alternatively, if a chop-focus Save Clue is given to a card that does not meet the above saving criteria, then it is not a Save Clue at all, and must be a Play Clue! Delayed Play Clues# When you receive a Play Clue, it does not necessarily mean that you can play that card immediately. Look around the table for other clued cards that might be related to the card that you got the Play Clue on. If there are any, you must wait for them to be played.For example, if Alice was clued about a bunch of 1's and then Bob is given a Play Clue on an unknown 2, Bob must wait for Alice to play all of her 1's first before playing the 2.In other words, treat all Play Clues as potential Delayed Play Clues.

How do players find the best move for a certain situation?Hanabi is very complicated, so it is impossible to write a guide on how to best solve each individual situation. (And that's a good thing, because the game continues to be interesting to play, even after thousands of games!)Luckily, beginners can focus on internalizing just three main principles. Nearly all of the special moves and strategies naturally flow from these principles. "},{"title":"1 - Good Touch Principle","type":1,"pageTitle":"Beginner's Guide","url":"docs/beginner#1---good-touch-principle","content":"When clues are given, we say that they \"touch\" cards. (On Hanab Live, cards that are touched by one or more clues are given a special border.)When cluing cards, we follow Good Touch Principle - this means that we only want to touch cards that will eventually be played. So, if someone touches a card that is already played on the stacks or a card that is already clued in someone else's hand, then that would be a Bad Touch.Good Touch Principle is a powerful building block for logic and reasoning. If everyone only touches good cards, then players can greatly narrow down the possibilities for all of the clued cards in their hand!  In the above screenshot: Alice wants to give a Play Clue to the yellow 2.Alice has a choice between cluing yellow and cluing number 2.If she clues number 2, it would uniquely touch the yellow 2 on slot 1.If she clues yellow, then it would touch slot 1, slot 2, and slot 3. This clue would violate Good Touch Principle, as the yellow 4's would be duplicated in Bob's hand.Thus, the correct clue for Alice to give is number 2.  In the above screenshot: Alice has an unknown purple card in her hand.Bob's hand is not important, so it is blacked out.Alice can see that the purple stack is played up to purple 4. The only other useful purple card left is the purple 5.Alice also knows that according to Good Touch Principle, every clued card will be eventually be played.Thus, by process of elimination, she can reason that the unknown purple card in her hand must be purple 5, and she can immediately play it.  In the above screenshot: In the middle of the game, Alice gives Bob a yellow clue that touches slots 2 and 3.The focus of the clue is on slot 2. This must be a Play Clue, so Bob marks his slot 2 card as a yellow 2.Slot 3 was also touched by the clue, but it was not the focus. But just because it was not the focus does not mean that it can just be any yellow card. From Good Touch Principle, Bob knows that it must be playable in the future. (In other words, if the slot 3 card was a yellow 1 or yellow 2, then Alice's clue would be a Bad Touch.)Therefore, Bob marks his slot 3 card as either yellow 3, yellow 4, or yellow 5. "},{"title":"2 - Save Principle","type":1,"pageTitle":"Beginner's Guide","url":"docs/beginner#2---save-principle","content":"The Save Clue section above explains that the team must save certain types of cards.But above and beyond this, we also agree that we must \"get\" all of the playable cards. In order words, we don't let each other discard playable cards!So, the full list of what the team must not let get discarded is the following: All 5'sUnique 2's (meaning that only one copy is currently visible)Critical cards (meaning that the other copy is discarded)Unique playable cards (meaning that only one copy is currently visible) This is called Save Principle and it is the most important principle of them all. You are allowed to break any other principle or rule in order to prevent a card in this list from being discarded! In fact, often times you will have to violate Good Touch Principle in order to save a specific card, and this is okay. "},{"title":"3 - Minimum Clue Value Principle (and Tempo Clues)","type":1,"pageTitle":"Beginner's Guide","url":"docs/beginner#3---minimum-clue-value-principle-and-tempo-clues","content":"Usually, players only discard when they have nothing to do. But don't take this the wrong way.In order to avoid discarding, you are not allowed to just clue any card. You are only allowed to give Save Clues to the specific cards outlined in the Save Principle section. And you are only allowed to give Play Clues to actual playable cards.Furthermore, you might be tempted to clue a card again that already has a clue on it in order to make it play right now. We call this kind of clue a Tempo Clue. A Tempo Clue is simply a Play Clue that does not \"get\" any brand new cards.Tempo Clues are quite inefficient (as the team is using two clues to get one card). Since Tempo Clues are so bad, we say that players are only allowed to perform Tempo Clues in certain special situations, like when a player is forced to give a clue.So, if your only option is between giving a Tempo Clue and discarding, then you must discard.We formally express this concept as Minimum Clue Value Principle: all clues must get at least one previously unclued card saved or played. In other words, as a group, we hold ourselves to a high standard, and we don't give inefficient clues.

When they do, they initiate the Mid-Game.The general goal of the Early Game is to extend it for as long as reasonably possible. Thus, everyone agrees that they must \"extinguish\" all of the available Play Clues and Save Clues before discarding. (There are no cards in the discard pile yet, but Save Clues still need to be given to all of the 5's on chop and all of the 2's on chop that are not present in someone else's hand.)In the Early Game, you can do a special move called a 5 Stall; see below. "},{"title":"The 5 Stall (Cluing Off-Chop 5's)","type":1,"pageTitle":"Beginner's Guide","url":"docs/beginner#the-5-stall-cluing-off-chop-5s","content":"Normally, you are only allowed to give a Save Clue to a 5 if it is on chop. So if you use number 5 to clue a 5 that is not on chop, then it will typically look like a Play Clue on that 5 (or some other advanced strategy).As a special rule, in the Early Game, you are allowed to clue number 5 as a Save Clue to off-chop 5's. Doing this is just interpreted as a \"stall\" clue and that you are trying to extend the Early Game for a little bit longer.However, you are only allowed to do this if there is nothing else to do, meaning that all of the \"normal\" Play Clues and Save Clues have been extinguished.Normally, a 5 Stall is only done in the Early Game. However, you might see someone give a 5 Stall in the Mid-Game if they are in a special situation where they are not allowed to discard. "},{"title":"Other General Strategy","type":1,"pageTitle":"Beginner's Guide","url":"docs/beginner#other-general-strategy","content":"In general, the first thing you should do on your turn is to look at the chop cards of everyone on the team. Are there any cards on chop that need to be saved (or Play Clued)? If so, do you have to do it, or can someone else do it? If no-one else can do it, then you need to give the Save Clue (or Play Clue), even if you have a card to play.If someone else can do it, would it be better for you to save the card, or for them? If they have a card to play and you do not have a card to play, then it is better teamwork for you to save the card. In general, Play Clues should be given over Save Clues. There's no need to give a Save Clue to someone if you can preoccupy them with playing a card!In general, if you have a choice, color clues should be given over number clues. Color clues are usually more specific, telling the player the exact identity of the card. (But of course, don't be afraid to use number clues if it helps to \"fill in\" other cards in the hand.)In general, don't be afraid of discarding. If you discard something important, it won't be your fault - it is your teammates' responsibility to save any important cards.  "},{"title":"Special Moves","type":1,"pageTitle":"Beginner's Guide","url":"docs/beginner#special-moves","content":"Hanabi is a game of trying to be as efficient as possible, since there is a limited number of clues.Thus, it is ideal to get two or more cards to play from one clue.Players can use two special \"moves\" to do this: Prompts and Finesses.  "},{"title":"The Prompt","type":1,"pageTitle":"Beginner's Guide","url":"docs/beginner#the-prompt","content":" In the above screenshot: Alice's hand is blacked out because it does not matter.Bob has a clued red card in his hand, but the full identity of the card is still unknown to him. In this situation, he knows he is supposed to just keep the card in his hand and continue to discard unclued cards.Alice clues red to Cathy, which touches a red 4. This must be a Play Clue on the red 4.Bob sees that red 4 is currently unplayable, since the red 3 is not played yet. Thus, this clue implies that someone has the red 3.Bob does not see a red 3 clued in anyone else's hand. So, Alice must be promising him that his unknown red card is red 3 and that he can safely play it. In this way, clues can deliver messages to an entirely different player than the person who actually received the clue.We call this move a Prompt because it is \"prompting\" a player to play a card that they would have otherwise held on to for a while longer.  If a player is Prompted and there are multiple cards in the hand that the Prompt could apply to, they should play the left-most.In the above screenshot: Bob is Prompted for a red 3 in the exact same way as the previous example.Bob has two different cards clued as red in slot 2 and slot 3.Since both cards are unknown to Bob, Bob should choose to play the slot 2 card since it is the left-most.  In the above screenshot: Bob has an unknown 3 in his hand.Alice clues number 4 to Bob, which touches a 4. It must be a Play Clue on the 4.There is no 4 that could possibly be playable right now. Thus, this must be a Self-Prompt, meaning that Bob's 3 must be either blue 3 or green 3.Bob plays his 3, and it is blue 3. Thus, he knows that the 4 must match and be a blue 4.  The Prompt is a promise that the player has the connecting card. Therefore, if the left-most card is not the correct one, the player should continue to play his clued cards (left to right) until the expected card is found. (It is of course the responsibility of the player giving the clue to ensure that all those previous cards will play successfully.)In the above screenshot: Bob has three separate unknown 3's in his hand.Alice clues red to Cathy, which touches the red 4. This is a Play Clue on the red 4.Bob sees that it is not playable and concludes that this is a Prompt and he must have the red 3. Bob plays his left-most 3 from slot 2.However, after playing it, Bob sees that it is not the red 3 - it was the blue 3 (which played successfully). Bob now knows that the next-left-most 3 must be the red 3 (on slot 3).Cathy can see the touched red 3 in Bob's hand and knows from the Good Touch Principle that her red card must be the 4. She does something unrelated.On his next turn, Bob tries to play his slot 3 card as red 3. However, after playing it, Bob sees that it was not the red 3 - it was the green 3 (which played successfully). Bob now knows that his final 3 must be red 3 (on slot 4).On his next turn, Bob plays his slot 4 card, and it is red 3.Cathy can now finally play her red 4.  "},{"title":"The Finesse","type":1,"pageTitle":"Beginner's Guide","url":"docs/beginner#the-finesse","content":" In the above screenshot: Alice's hand is blacked out because it does not matter.Bob has no clued cards in his hand.Alice clues a red to Cathy, which touches a red 4. This must be a Play Clue on the red 4.Bob sees that red 4 is currently unplayable. Thus, assuming Alice is not making a mistake, this clue implies that someone has the red 3...Bob does not see a red 3 clued in anyone else's hand. So, Alice must be promising him that his has the red 3.But where is it? Bob knows that this is the Finesse convention, and he is promised that his left-most unclued card is the red 3.Bob blind-plays his slot 1 card, and it is the red 3.Cathy sees the blind-play happen immediately after this red clue, so she knows that she must have the connecting red card, red 4.Cathy plays the red 4. Note that Prompts take precedence over Finesses! Players should never blind-play a card if the situation can apply to the clued cards in their hand.When a Finesse occurs, it causes temporary information desynchronization. (In the above example, if Bob did nothing, Cathy would go on to think that she had the red 3, but she really doesn't have the red 3, which means that information is not synced up throughout the team.)For this reason, blind-playing a card into a Finesse is very important - by doing so, it resynchronizes all of the information. So, if a player is Finessed, they should usually blind-play the card immediately, even if they have other important cards to play or some good clue to give.  We define the Finesse Position as the slot that a player's left-most unclued card is in. Notice that a player's Finesse Position can move around, and if it does, it is still possible to Finesse them.In the above screenshot: Alice clues Cathy red, which touches two red cards on slot 1 and slot 2.Cathy assumes that the slot 1 card is red 1.Next, Bob clues Donald blue, which touches a blue 2.Cathy assumes that this is a Finesse and that she must have a blue 1.Now, it is Cathy's turn. Blind-playing the blue 1 is more important than playing the red 1.Normally, the Finesse Position would be the left-most card. However, since Cathy's slot 1 and slot 2 card are already clued, Cathy's Finesse Position card has shifted down to her slot 3. Thus, she must blind-play the blue 1 from slot 3.

Alternatively, you could also play a test game with yourself (where you control both of the players). You can do that by using an incognito window and logging into a separate test account. Create a Discord account and login to the Hanabi Discord server.

If there are people currently playing, then the typical thing to do is to join the voice channel with the others, wait for the current game to end, and then hop into the next game after that (depending on how many people stick around). A few things to note regarding that: In the Hyphen-ated Group, after every game we play, we do a post-game review so that we can find the best moves for every turn and have everyone learn from their mistakes. So before you can hop into the next game, you will have to wait for both the game to finish and the post-game review to finish. We try to keep the post-game reviews short, but if an interesting situation happens or a discussion gets heated, then it might take a while. ;)If there are 6 or more players remaining after the post-game review is finished, then we usually split into two separate groups of 3.Don't worry - it is not considered rude to join a voice channel and listen in on an ongoing game or post-game review. If someone asks who you are, feel free to introduce yourself. Otherwise, wait until the end of the review to introduce yourself, and then hop into the next game.Additionally, make sure to inquire if there are other beginners in the voice channel. If there are beginners, then the group is probably already playing \"level-1-conventions-only\" or \"beginner\" games, which is what you want.

For example, in a 4-player game: It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.Alice clues red to Donald, touching a red 1 as a Play Clue. This is a direct Play Clue - the red 1 can be played on the stacks as soon as it gets to Donald's turn.Next, it is Bob's turn. Bob clues red to Cathy, touching a red 2 as a Delayed Play Clue - the red 2 cannot be played on the stacks as soon as it gets to Cathy's turn.Next, it is Cathy's turn. Cathy must wait patiently for Donald to play the red 1 first, and then play the red 2 on her next turn. As a rule, we treat all Play Clues as Delayed Play Clues.For example, if Alice was clued about a bunch of 1's and then Bob is given a Play Clue on an unknown 2, Bob must wait for Alice to play all of her 1's first before playing the 2.Since we treat all Play Clues as Delayed Play Clues, the distinction between them is pretty much irrelevant. In the Hyphen-ated Group, we use the phrase Play Clue to mean either a Play Clue or a Delayed Play Clue.Additionally, when we say that an unclued card is currently playable, we do not mean that the card would be able to play on the stacks right this instant. If an unclued card is playable, then what we really mean is that it would be legal for someone to give either a Play Clue or a Delayed Play Clue to the card.

Instead, players agree that this signals an Ejection and that the next player should play their Second Finesse Position. Prompts don't factor into the \"two or more blind-plays\" rule. Players only count the number of blind-plays. After the blind-play, the player who received the clue will know that they must have a 5.Note that 5 Color Ejection only applies if the 5 did not have any clues on it already. If a 5 is re-clued, it signals a Finesse on all of the cards leading up to the 5. However, the \"invisible\" clue from a Chop Move does not count. In other words, you can perform a 5 Color Ejection with a Chop Moved 5, as long as the card does not have any positive clues on it. For example, in a 3-player game: It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a red 5 on slot 3.Bob knows that normally, this would be a Finesse on the 5, indicating to Bob that he has the red 1, the red 2, the red 3, and the red 4. However, since this calls for more than one blind card, he knows that 5 Color Ejection should take precedence, so he knows to play his Second Finesse Position card. It is a red 1 and it successfully plays.From Cathy's perspective, if Bob had played his Finesse Position card in response to the red clue, then Cathy would know that it was a Finesse or a Bluff. But since Bob blind-played his Second Finesse Position card, it must be a 5 Color Ejection. Cathy marks the red card as red 5. In the previous example, a 5 Color Ejection was preformed with the 5 being the only brand new card introduced with the color clue. However, it is also possible to perform a 5 Color Ejection with more than one card introduced. Normally, this kind of thing would signal an Out-of-Order Finesse, but the 5 Color Ejection interpretation should take precedence as long as the next player would have to blind-play two or more cards.For example, in a 3-player game: It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a red 5 on slot 2 and a red 2 on slot 3.Bob knows that normally, this would be an Out-of-Order Finesse on the 5, indicating to Bob that he has the red 1, the red 3, and the red 4.

Since Alice did not clue it, Bob must have the other copy in his hand.Bob has not discarded since the 2 Save was given to him earlier on. Thus, he knows that one of his three clued 2's must be the other copy of the red 2, so he marks all three cards as \"possible red 2\".However, these notes are asymmetric - Alice and Bob write the notes, but Cathy does not. (Cathy has no idea that this is happening because Cathy cannot see her own red 2 on chop.)Alice and Bob will have to keep this information desync in mind going forward. By default, players should never assume that other players have asymmetric information. This is because having asymmetric information is the exception, rather than the norm.In the previous example, Bob might perform an action later on in the game that seems to demonstrate that he knows he has the red 2.

The clued 5 is not actually related to the blind-play. This is why it is called a Pull instead of a Finesse or a Bluff.5 Pulls are typically done to 5's that are on slot 1. But, for example, you can also clue a 5 in slot 2 in order to get a blind-play on slot 3.5 Pulls take precedence over Finesses and Bluffs, because a number 5 clue is never considered to be Play Clue. For example: It is the Early Game and the Low Score Phase.Red 3 is played on the stacks.Alice clues Cathy number 5, touching a red 5 on slot 1. (There are other Play Clues for Alice to give, so this cannot be a 5 Stall.)Normally, Bob would think that this is a Finesse and that he should blind-play his Finesse Position card as the red 4.However, Bob knows that Play Clues with a number 5 clue are \"turned off\" in the Low Score Phase, which means that Alice is not indicating that the red 5 is playable.Bob can see that there is a playable blue 1 to the right of the 5, so Alice must be intending a 5 Pull. When it gets to Cathy's turn, Cathy will blind-play that card. Since 5 Pulls are never Play Clues on the 5, it is possible to 5 Pull a 4 without promising that the 5 matches the suit.Confusingly, 5 Pulls work differently from Finesses. Even though they involve playing a blind card, a 5 Pull should be treated as a Delayed Play Clue (or a potential Prompt). This means that the blind card could play through any existing touched cards.When a player is Finessed or Bluffed, they are allowed to defer playing the blind card in order to do a Finesse or Bluff of their own. However, if they could be Bluffed, they are not allowed to initiate a 5 Pull. (Players are still allowed to defer playing into a Finesse in order to initiate a 5 Pull.)In the rare case where a 5 Pull is performed in a 3-player game by touching two 5's in slot 1 and slot 3, then the 5 Pulled card is slot 2.For expert players, we define a specific interaction between 5's Chop Moves / 5 Pulls and 2 Saves.

In this case, unless there is some really good clue to give, there are no decisions to be made - they just play their one playable card.What if a player has two or more playable cards to play? Which card should they play first?If one of the cards is not completely known yet (e.g. a playable 2 of unknown color), then the player might want to play that card first in order to find out exactly what it is. In general, nothing special is triggered by players playing an unknown card.On the other hand, something special can be triggered if a player plays a fully-known card, because they knew exactly what they were doing. Our group agrees that playable cards should be played in a specific order. We refer to this as Priority. The agreed Priority is as follows: Priority\tCategory of card\tReason1\tBlind-plays\tDemonstrating that a Finesse or Bluff occurred is very important. 2\tCards that lead into clued cards in someone else's hand\tOtherwise, the team would lose Tempo. 3\tCards that lead into the player's own hand\tIt is bad for a suit to be \"held up\" on one player. 4\t5's\tPlaying a 5 gets the team a free clue. 5\tThe lower rank card\tThe smaller stacks are more important to fill up. 6\tThe left-most card\tThe left-most card is more likely to be good. If someone plays a fully-known card and the card does not have Priority, then the player must be trying to send a special message.Based on what card they did play, if you have any clued cards in your hand that match the next \"connecting\" card, it is a message that you can play it right now as a Priority Prompt. (This is similar to a normal Prompt, except instead of initiating the Prompt with a clue, they initiated it with the order that they played cards.)Alternatively, if you do not have any clued cards in your hand that matches the card that they played, then you should play your Finesse Position card as a Priority Finesse.For example, in a 3-player game: Alice has a clued + known playable red 1 and a clued + known playable blue 2 in her hand.Alice plays blue 2.Bob comes next. Bob knows that normally, when you have a choice between two cards, you are supposed to play the lowest rank card. (Unless it is a blind-play, or it leads into someone's hand, or it is a 5.) Bob does not see any blue 3's, so he knows that Alice was supposed to play the red 1 instead of the blue 2. Alice did not play the card with Priority.This means that Bob must have a blue 3. Bob does not have any clued cards in his hand, so he blind-plays his Finesse Position card. Similar to a normal Prompt, if a Priority Prompt could apply to two or more clued cards, then you should play the left-most one.Similar to a normal Prompt, if a Priority Prompt made you play the left-most card and it was not the matching card, then you should continuing playing clued cards until you find the matching card.

"},{"title":"Priority Exceptions","type":1,"pageTitle":"Level 12 - Adept","url":"docs/level_12#priority-exceptions","content":"Priority does not always apply. Some common exceptions are listed below. 1) End-Game# Priority is generally \"turned off\" in the End-Game, because players often need to play specific cards.With that said, Priority can still work if a player plays a card that would be really terrible for the team otherwise. 2) The 4's Priority Exception# If a player has a known playable 5 and a known playable 4 that leads into their own hand, then according to the above Priority table, the known playable 4 would have Priority. However, this does not make much sense, since the 5 has to be played no matter what, playing the 5 gives the team a clue back, the 4 could be played by someone else, and so on.Thus, if a player has a known playable 5 and a known playable 4 that leads into their own hand, then the 5 is said to have Priority. 3) Blind-Playing Globally-Known Cards# Normally, blind-playing cards has Priority over everything else.However, in some advanced cases, the blind-play does not need to be demonstrated to the team - everyone already has full knowledge of what is going on. In this case, players are supposed to treat the cards as clued for the purposes of finding the Priority. (The Gentleman's Discards is the main move that this applies to.) 4) \"Important\" Cards# Normally, cards that are the same rank should be played from left-to-right.However, in certain situations, players can know that some other card is more important than the left-most card. If a player plays a \"more important\" card, it should never trigger a \"right-to-left\" style Priority Finesse.For example, in a 3-player game: In the Early Game, Alice clues number 2 to Bob, touching three 2's on slot 3, slot 4, and slot 5 (his chop). (This is the 2 Save convention.)Later on in the game, all of the 1's are now played on the stacks.Bob has not received any other clues since then - all of his 2's are known playable, but he has no idea what color they are.Normally, Bob knows that he is supposed to play his 2's from left-to-right. However, he also knows that his 2 on slot 5 is the most important card out of all of them - it was the focus of the original 2 Save by Alice.Thus, Bob plays his 2 on slot 5 first. After that, he plays the 2's from left-to-right like normal.

In these cases, it might still be good to play the card without Priority, just so that the player with the next card will have something to do on their turn.However, if they do play the card without Priority, it will cause an impending misplay because the target player will think the card is actually on their Finesse Position. Thus, doing this forces someone to give a clue to the card directly in order to stop the misplay.This clue is similar to a Fix Clue, since it fixes an impending misplay. But we specifically call this kind of clue a Load Clue to differentiate it from a Fix Clue that fixes a Lie or mistake. It is a Load Clue because it is loading the player up with something to do on their turn.If you receive a Load Clue, you should suspect that you might have something valuable on your chop, as this would be an excellent reason to commit the team to giving the Load Clue in the first place.If a player has a choice between playing one card that leads nowhere and playing one card that commits the team to giving a Load Clue, then they are not obligated to choose one or the other - they can choose whichever one is best for the situation.When a player receives a Load Clue, they are to interpret it as a normal Play Clue instead of a Fix Clue. For example, in a 3-player game: Red 1 and blue 1 are played on the stacks.Alice has a choice between playing a known red 2 or a known blue 2. The red 2 has Priority because it is the left-most card.Alice plays the blue 2.Bob sees that Cathy's hand is as follows, from newest to oldest: yellow 4, yellow 3, yellow 4, red 1, blue 3.Bob sees that Cathy will think that Alice is performing a Priority Finesse on the blue 3. Thus, Bob must now give a Load Clue to stop the impending misplay.Bob clues number 3 to Cathy.Cathy is surprised - she was about to play her Finesse Position card as a blue 3, but she now knows that it can't be a blue 3.If this was a Fix Clue, Cathy might be inclined to play the card that was closest to her slot 1 (which would be the 3 on slot 2).However, Cathy knows that Load Clues are to be interpreted as normal Play Clues instead of Fix Clues, so she interprets this as a normal Chop-Focus Play Clue and plays blue 3 from slot 5.

Since they have already blind-played their first card in the layer, they have demonstrated that the Finesse was on them, and now everyone on the team knows that the rest of the cards inside of the layer are \"gotten\" for sure.Note that this only applies when the card that was blind-played was unrelated to the original Layered Finesse. For example, if a player is finessed for both the red 1 and the red 2 and has just blind-played a green 1, then they can perform a Paused Priority Finesse, because everyone on the team knows that the green 1 played as red 1 and therefore that the layer is not yet unraveled.However, if a player is finessed for both the red 1 and the red 2 and has just blind-played the red 1, then they cannot perform a Paused Priority Finesse because they haven't demonstrated to the team that they are still finessed for the red 2.

From Cathy's perspective, Bob will incorrectly mark his 2 as a red 2 (but it is really a blue 2). If nothing else happens, Bob will go on to misplay that card.Cathy knows that technically, she could give a Fix Clue to Bob to fix the situation. However, is that what Alice really intended? That would be a waste of a clue and would be really inefficient.

This must be what Alice intended all along, which means that Bob must not actually have the red 2. (The red 2 is already played now, so Bob knows that Alice would not violate Good Touch Principle.) Bob updates his note from \"red 2\" to \"blue 2, green 2, yellow 2, or purple 2\". In this example, Cathy knows that the initial clue was \"diseased\", and Cathy blind-plays a card to \"heal\" the situation. This is where the name Pestilent Double Bluff comes from.In this example, Cathy blind-plays the exact copy of the card that Bob was mistaken about. However, notice that Cathy could actually blind-play any playable card. Even if Cathy does not blind-play the red 2, blind-playing a card would still \"heal\" the situation, because Bob would know that Cathy is blind-playing from Alice's clue.A Pestilent Double Bluff is similar to a normal Double Bluff in that it gets two people in a row to blind-play their Finesse Position, getting two unrelated cards. However, unlike a normal Double Bluff, a Pestilent Double Bluff is initiated by cluing a one-away-from-playable card (instead of a two-or-more-away-from-playable card).Furthermore, consider the case where Cathy sees a red 2 in the middle of someone else's hand (e.g. Donald's hand). In this hypothetical, Cathy could just give a Play Clue to the red 2 in Donald's hand, Donald would play the card. This clue would \"heal\" the situation, because Bob would no longer think that he has the red 2. However, we agree that Cathy should not do this and should still blind-play her Finesse Position card. (This is because doing something weird like this for a 3-for-2 is not strong enough.)Additionally, consider the case where Cathy sees both copies of red 2 in someone else's hand (e.g. Donald's hand). In this hypothetical, Bob would not go on to misplay the red 2, so no further action is needed to heal the situation. However, we agree that Cathy should still blind-play her Finesse Position card (as a Known Pestilent Double Bluff).

So it must instead be a Reverse Elimination Finesse.The Elimination Finesse promises that it is her oldest card, so she plays slot 5 as blue 3. As mentioned above, Chop Moved cards should be skipped over when finding the Elimination Finesse target. If there are two or more cards with Elimination Notes on them and they are all Chop Moved, then the oldest Chop Moved card should be played.Elimination Finesses apply to all types of situations with Elimination Notes (including Double Discard Elimination Notes). Subsequently, you can more specifically describe an Elimination Finesse as a Discard Elimination Finesse or a Double Discard Elimination Finesse.Note that normal Finesses take priority over Self-Elimination Finesses. For example, in a 3-player game: On the stacks, red 2 and blue 2 are played.Alice's hand is completely unclued. Alice has Elimination Notes on slot 3 and slot 4 for red 3.Cathy clues a number 4 in Alice's slot 1 as a Self-Finesse.If Alice's 4 is a blue 4, then this would be a normal Self-Finesse, and Alice should blind-play blue 3 from slot 2.If Alice's 4 is a red 4, then this would be an Elimination Self-Finesse, and Alice should blind-play red 3 from slot 4.Alice knows that in this situation, you always supposed to assume a normal Finesse, so she blind-plays blue 3 from slot 2.

In other words, the focused slot should be evaluated before the clue was given (just like how every other clue works).For example, in 3-player game: Red 1 is played on the stacks.Alice discards red 2.

And indeed, when players see a really good clue, they should probably defer blind-playing to give the clue. But there are limits.When a player knows for sure that they are Finessed (instead of Bluffed), then deferring a Finesse (to perform another Finesse or Bluff) is great! It has almost no downsides, other than the obvious loss of tempo. Everyone on the team is \"in the know\", so to speak.When a player could be Bluffed, deferring a Bluff can be extremely dangerous because it causes Information Desynchronization throughout the team.Deferring a Bluff to perform a Finesse can be pretty clear, depending on the situation. It should be done sparingly. Note that deferring a Bluff to perform a Finesse can potentially lose the game if the original cluer is performing a Double Half Bluff. So there is some risk involved. Deferring a Bluff to perform another Bluff is much worse. Since the Bluff was not immediately resolved, the game state \"fractures\" into two valid game states for the receivers of each clue (e.g. the player who received the clue that initiated the first Bluff, and the player who received the clue that initiated the Deferred Bluff). This means that these two players will have to entertain two entire hypothetical game states in their mind and build upon each hypothetical with each new piece of information. This makes it extremely difficult for them to plan ahead or make correct decisions during their turns.Thus, deferring a Bluff to do another Bluff should almost never be performed.Also, see the below section on Deferring a Double Bluff.

Then it wouldn't be Chop Moving anything.From Good Touch Principle, we know that it is pointless to spend a clue to touch a useless card on someone's chop, because if we just do nothing, the useless card will get automatically discarded.Subsequently, if this is done deliberately, it must have a meaning. By doing this, it means that we want to \"push\" the card that is next to the useless card onto the table.For example, in a 3-player game: All of the 1's are played on the stacks.Bob has no clued cards in his hand.

Then, they will go on to misplay that card, mistaking it for a \"normal\" Play Clue.If players misrepresent the identity of a trash card in this way, it is a signal for the next person to blind-play their Finesse Position card. This is extremely similar to how a Finesse or a Bluff works (e.g. a clued card has been misrepresented as being immediately playable).Trash Bluffs are a good tool to get a card played that is sitting behind other annoying cards.For example, in a 3-player game: On the stacks, all of the 1's are played except for red 1.Cathy has no clued cards in her hand.Alice clues Cathy number 1, which only touches her newest (slot 1) card. This card is a blue 1, but Cathy will assume that it is a red 1.Bob blind-plays his Finesse Position card, and it is a playable blue 2.Cathy now knows that her 1 must not be red 1, or else Bob would not have blind-played anything. The 1 must be some other trash card. Just like normal Bluffs, Trash Bluffs can only be done while in Bluff Seat.Normal Bluffs take precedence over Trash Bluffs. This means that players can only use cards to Trash Bluff with if they will be proved to be trash by a blind-play. For example, if not all of the 1's have been played on the stacks, then you can use a number 1 clue to initiate a Trash Bluff, because a blind-play will prove that the clued 1 is not a good 1.For example, if the red stack is played up to the red 3, then you cannot use a red clue to initiate a Trash Bluff, because a blind-play will make the clued card look like the red 5.For example, if the red stack is played up to the red 4, then you can use a red clue to initiate a Trash Bluff, because a blind-play will prove that the clued card is not a red 5. In the case where multiple cards are clued as part of a Trash Bluff, all of the touched cards are considered to be trash. However, the focus of the clue should be the first thing discarded, which allows for the possibility of your teammates to give a follow-up Fix Clue.

For example, a blue clue on a blue 2 matches a blind-play of blue 1. Or, a number 2 clue on blue 2 matches a blind-play of blue 1.In a Bluff, we would say that the clue does not \"match\" the blind-play. For example, a blue clue on a blue 2 does not match a blind-play of a red 1. Or, a number 2 clue on a blue 2 does not match the blind-play of a red 2.In the Trash Bluff example above, a blue 1 is used to Trash Bluff a blue 2. Similar to a Bluff, we would say this number 1 clue does not match the blind-play of a blue 2.What if the Trash Bluff instead got a red 1 to blind-play? In this context, the red 1 would actually \"match\" the number 1 clue. Another way of saying this is that by cluing the trash 1 with a number 1 clue, the clue giver is saying that they see a matching 1 that is good.Thus, it is possible to perform a Trash Bluff outside of Bluff Seat if the \"matching\" card is on someone's Finesse Position. When this is done, it promises that someone has that specific card, so we call it a Trash Finesse rather than a Trash Bluff.For example, in a 4-player game: All the 1's are played on the stacks except for red 1.Alice clues number 1 to Donald, which touches a blue 1. To Donald, this will look like it is a red 1.At first glance, Bob might think this is a Trash Bluff, causing him to blind-play his Finesse Position card as either red 1 or some other currently-playable card.However, Bob also sees that Cathy has a red 1 on her Finesse Position. Thus, Alice's clue was a Trash Finesse instead of a Trash Bluff, since it is promises a playable 1.Thus, Bob discards.Cathy blind-plays her Finesse Position card and it is red 1.Donald discards his known-trash 1. Double Trash Finesses are explicitly disallowed. Thus, it is possible to perform a Trash Finesse in a situation like this: All the 1's are played on the stacks except for red 1 and blue 1.Alice clues number 1 to Donald, which touches two green 1's on slot 1 and 2. To Donald, this will look like it is both the red 1 and the blue 1.Like in the previous example, Bob sees that Cathy has a red 1 on her Finesse Position.At first glance, Bob might think that Alice is promising both red 1 and blue 1, which would mean that he would need to blind-play the blue 1.However, a Trash Finesse only promises at least one matching card, and since he sees that Cathy has a matching card, then that is good enough. Thus, Bob discards.Cathy blind-plays her Finesse Position card and it is red 1.Donald knows that the focus of the clue (slot 1) is certainly trash, since that caused Cathy to blind-play.Furthermore, Donald knows that his slot 2 card is also trash, because all the cards touched in a Trash Bluff or Trash Finesse are guaranteed to be trash.

This is much harder to see than a forward Trash Finesse. Even so, players should generally entertain the possibility of this occurring.When a clue looks like it could be a Reverse Trash Finesse, the player who receives the clue is forced into immediately discarding the card. If it was indeed a Reverse Trash Finesse, it will be a trash card and it will immediately demonstrate what is going on. Alternatively, if the clue was a normal Play Clue on a playable card, then the discard will be a Gentleman's Discard. By discarding, it covers both cases.For example, in 3-player game: The red 1 is played on the stacks. All of the 2's are played on the other stacks.Alice clues number 2 to Bob, touching his slot 1 card as a Play Clue.From Bob's perspective, this is probably just a Play Clue on the red 2 (which happens to be the final 2 that needs to be played).However, Bob sees that Cathy also has a red 2 on her Finesse Position. That means that this could be a Reverse Trash Finesse.If it is a Reverse Trash Finesse, then his 2 is a trash 2 (e.g. green 2). By immediately discarding it, it will prove to Cathy that she has a red 2.Alternatively, if Bob does indeed have the red 2, then he can discard it to perform a Gentleman's Discard on Cathy.Either way, discarding will cover both cases. Bob discards the 2 and it is revealed to be a green 2.Cathy comes next. Cathy was highly surprised when Alice gave Bob a number 2 clue on the green 2. From Cathy's perspective of Bob's perspective, the green 2 clue would immediately misplay as red 2. However, when Bob discards the green 2 instead of playing it, Alice's plan becomes clear. Cathy had the red 2 all along. Cathy blind-plays her Finesse Position card as red 2. Note that Reverse Trash Finesses should not always be entertained and depend on context. Specifically, towards the end of the game, Reverse Trash Finesses are \"turned off\".

However, this is a special situation: when the original Finesse was given, it was a message that the focus of the clue was playable. Information Lock Principle applies, and it means that the original focus of the clue is also playable.For example, in a 3-player game: At the beginning of the game, Alice goes first.Bob has a red 3 and a red 2 (on slots 1 and 2 respectively).Cathy has a red 1 on slot 1 (in Finesse Position).Alice clues Bob red (as an Out-of-Order Reverse Finesse).

An untruth that does not resolve immediately is a Lie.Normally, Lies are expressly illegal. However, some players will occasionally break the rules for the purposes of getting a Finesse. We call such moves Finesses with a Lie Component.Typically, when players Lie out of Bluff Seat, the game quickly falls apart; subsequent clues will have different meanings to different players and everyone will become \"desynchronized\". This typically leads to a loss.With that said, it is sometimes possible to construct safe lines that contain a Lie Component. There is usually deep levels of nuance involved in these lines, so this kind of thing is only recommended for advanced and expert players.The previously mentioned Out-of-Order Finesse is a specific example of a Finesse with a Lie Component. One key attribute of the Out-of-Order Finesse is that the player who receives the Fix Clue knows that all of the related cards are playable, or it would not have been worth the risk (and the confusion) to perform a line with a Lie Component in the first place.This concept can be generalized to all Finesses that have a Lie Component. After a player receives a Fix Clue in such a situation, they should assume that the Finesse is \"still on\". So, depending on the situation, they should either know that the initial card that was clued is playable (like in an Out-of-Order Finesse) or continue to blind-play cards to fulfill the initial Finesse (if the card clued with a Fix Clue seems to be unrelated).Importantly, Finesses with a Lie Component are only allowed if there is not an alternative line that would \"get\" the same number of cards without any lies. Thus, if you are looking to do a Finesse with a Lie Component, make sure you carefully consider the efficiency of all of the possible alternatives.

The team will likely get a misplay at some point in the future. If the above example happens and Alice is not making a mistake, then Alice must be trying to communicate something extra.

The red 1 is focused. This looks like a Play Clue on the red 1.Bob knows that this must be an Unknown Trash Discharge, so he blind-plays his Third Finesse Position.

For example, it is common for other people on the team to discard in order to let the player with the Phantom Playable card be the one to give a Play Clue to the in-between card.Sometimes, Phantom Playable cards have to be discarded when the team is low on clues or in an otherwise tight situation.

In summary, it is better for the team to let a Phantom Playable card get discarded in a tricky or tight situation, especially if it is a 4.Another way of saying this is that the team should never \"bend over backwards\" for a Phantom Playable card.

And in this situation, it does not imply a Sarcastic Discard or a Gentleman's Discard.Sometimes, when a Locked player discards a non-critical card, it is a Generation Discard, and sometimes, it is a Sacrifice Discard.

However, unlike a Scream Discard, it is permissible to use a Shout Discard to Chop Move any card that is desirable, even if it is not critical or playable.Normally, a Scream Discard is only allowed if the team is at 0 clues (or if cluing the card is impossible). However, unlike a Scream Discard, it is permissible to use a Shout Discard to Chop Move regardless of the number of clues that the team has.Normally, a Scream Discard would turn into an Echo Scream Discard if the next player has a playable card.

This is more subtle than a Scream Discard though, so it is called a Whisper Discard.Whisper Discards are to be treated identically to Scream Discards.

This second Scream Discard is called a Rebellious Discard, because they are not doing what they are told.For example, in a 3-player game: Red 4 is in the discard pile.There are 0 clues available.Alice has a known-playable blue 2.Bob has a critical red 4 on chop. Bob has no playable cards in his hand.Cathy's hand is Locked. All of the cards in Cathy's hand are critical.

All of the 2's are played on the other stacks.Alice clues number 2 to Bob, touching his slot 1 card as a Play Clue.From Bob's perspective, this is probably just a Play Clue on the red 2 (which happens to be the final 2 that needs to be played).However, Bob sees that Cathy also has a red 2 on her Finesse Position. That means that this could be a Reverse Trash Finesse.If it is a Reverse Trash Finesse, then his 2 is a trash 2 (e.g. green 2). By immediately discarding it, it will prove to Cathy that she has a red 2.Alternatively, if Bob does indeed have the red 2, then he can discard it to perform a Gentleman's Discard on Cathy.Either way, discarding will cover both cases. Bob discards the 2 and it is revealed to be a red 2.Cathy blind-plays her Finesse Position card as red 2 and it successfully plays.Alice discards.Bob knows that even though Gentleman's Discards are never supposed to cause a Chop Move, Alice forced him to discard in exactly the same way as a Reverse Trash Finesse. Furthermore, it was possible to cleanly clue the red 2 in Cathy's hand to begin with, and doing so would have been much simpler. Thus, doing the pseudo-Reverse Trash Finesse was unnecessary.Since it was unnecessary, Bob chop moves all the cards to the right of where the red 2 was (slot 2, slot 3, slot 4, and slot 5).

This is similar to how Bob should always prefer a Finesse interpretation over a Bluff interpretation.For example, in a 4-player game: All of the 2's are played on the stacks.Alice clues number 1 to Cathy, touching a single 1 on her chop. Since all of the 1's are already played, it is globally known that this must be some kind of Trash Push.Bob sees that the pushed card is a red 3. Cathy has no other red cards in her hand, so Alice could have just clued red to Cathy instead of doing a complicated Trash Push.Thus, Bob knows that this is an Unnecessary Trash Push.

Players can simply play their playable card and let someone else on the team \"get\" the next card. Being Selfish is typically associated with having bad teamwork.However, in rare cases, giving a Selfish Clue can be good.For example, in a 3-player game: All the 1's are played on the stacks.Alice has a globally-known playable red 2 in her hand.Bob hand is as follows, from newest to oldest: blue 1, red 3, red 4, red 5, blue 1Both Bob and Cathy has a safe discard.Alice knows that on this turn, she is expected to play the red 2, unless she has a really good clue to give.Alice sees that if she plays the red 2, then Bob will probably have nothing to do, and will go on to discard the blue 1.At that point, the red 5 will be on chop, and it will be difficult for the team to get all of the red cards. Specifically, someone will probably have to give a number 3 clue to Bob as a 1-for-1 on the red 3.Alice sees that if she gives a red clue to Bob right now (e.g. before she plays the red 2), then she will be able to \"lock-in\" a nice 3-for-1 clue.

Sometimes, when both a color clue and a number would violate Good Touch Principle, players are forced to pick between the lesser of two evils.However, sometimes you can see that it is possible to use a color or number clue to uniquely touch a clue target without \"picking up\" extra bad cards. So, when extra bad cards are deliberately touched in this way, it is conveying an extra special message.When this occurs and there is exactly one \"missing\" card, players should write an Elimination Note in their hand for the missing card. This is called Trash Touch Elimination.For example, in a 3-player game: Red 3 is played on the stacks. All of the other suits have the 1 played on the stacks.Bob's hand is, from newest to oldest: red 4, red 1, blue 1, green 1, yellow 1.Alice wants to give a play clue to the red 4.

However, sometimes it can be seen that there is nothing special going on and that everybody has safe chop cards.In such a situation, if the player is not making a mistake, the only reason that they would discard is that they are allowing for the possibility of a Prompt or a Reverse Finesse - someone else on the team has a playable card (either clued or on Finesse Position) that \"matches\" the card that they got the Play Clue on.Depending on the game state, clever players may be able to blind-play their Finesse Position card in response to this hesitation, getting a card for \"free\". This kind of move is called a Hesitation Blind-Play.For example, in a 3-player game: Red 1 and all of the other 2's are played on the stacks.The team has 5 clues. Nobody on the team has any cards clued in their hand.Alice clues number 3 to Bob, touching a blue 3 on slot 1 as a Play Clue. (The team is now at 4 clues.)Bob discards.

Hesitation Blind-Plays are not always safe to do: If a player could be hesitating for a clued card in your hand or your Finesse Position card, then you cannot act on the hesitation. (If you guess wrong, you could misplay a critical card.)If a player could be hesitating for a card that is identical to the card that was clued, then you cannot act on the hesitation. (If you blind-play the same copy of the card, then they will go on to misplay the clued card.)If blind-playing a particular card would cause the original clue to look like a Double Finesse with a \"self\" component, then you cannot act on the hesitation.

However, sometimes it can be very slow (low tempo), as players will have to allow for all possible Reverse Finesses before playing anything. This is generally not a problem in 3-player games, but tempo is important in 5-player games.Normally, when the Finesse Target (the card that is to be blind-played) is clued directly, it is a mistake due to someone not paying close enough attention. We refer to this as Stomping on a Finesse.However, if high tempo is needed, a player can consider intentionally stomping on a Layered Finesse in order to \"speed up\" the play of a specific card that leads into other players hands.One complicating factor of the Speed-up Clue is how to differentiate it from a more-ordinary Fix Clue. In other words, after the clued card is played, on their next turn, should the player go back and blind-play the other cards? If it was a Speed-up Clue, they should. If it was a Fix Clue, they should not.The key lies in the context of the clue: Would another player have tried to blind-play something before the potential Fix Clue was given? If yes, then it is not a Fix Clue, and it is a Speed-up Clue.Was it possible to take an equivalent line where a Fix Clue would not be needed? (In terms of the same number of clues, and no risk of discarding critical/playable cards.) If yes, it is not a Speed-up Clue.

This means that you can never blind-discard the promised card to perform a Gentleman's Discard, for example.After the Finesse has occurred, but before the promised card has been blind-played, there is a window where a teammate might find strategic value in duplicating the promised card in someone else's hand.Unless the duplication was a last-resort, if the teammate duplicates the blind card, it promises that the duplicated card is on Finesse Position (and there is no Layered Finesse), which allows the recipient of the Finesse to blind-discard that card, similar to a Certain Discard.Finally, from the perspective of the player receiving the clue, if they end up playing the duplicated card first, then they should know that the focus of the original clue was on the other, non-duplicated card, and they can play it immediately afterwards. (Otherwise, the original clue would be fairly low-value.)Note that as long as the duplication clue touches two or more cards, the Certain Discard Duplication Promise interpretation takes priority over the Unknown Trash Discharge interpretation.

In other words, this means that it is illegal for a player to perform a Clandestine Finesse on the very next player that targets a potentially duplicated card and the other player can rule out the possibility of a Bluff.For example, in a 3-player game: All of the 2's & blue 3 is played on the stacks. Green 3 is in the discard pile.Alice has an unknown 3 in her hand that happens to be the red 3.Alice clues number 4 to Cathy, touching a red 4 as a Play Clue.Bob knows that Alice could be trying to perform a Finesse on a red 3. Normally, he would blind-discard his Finesse Position card as a Certain Discard in order to pass this card back to Alice.However, Bob also knows that this might be a Bluff. But wait - his Finesse Position card has negative blue on it. So anything that he blind-plays here would have to be a 3. Thus, this cannot be a Bluff, since a 3 would match a 4 and look like a Finesse.The only other possibility that Bob has to worry about is a Clandestine Finesse. For example, he could be blind-playing a green 3 and then a red 3 after that. If he blind-discarded, that could \"kill\" the green stack, since the other copy of green 3 is already discarded.However, Bob also knows that you are not allowed to perform a Clandestine Finesse from Bluff Seat that could duplicate a card in your hand. Thus, he can discount both the possibility of a Bluff and the possibility of a Clandestine Finesse.Bob performs a Certain Discard on his Finesse Position card and it is the red 3, successfully passing it back to Alice. If someone performs a Certain Discard and you have two or more clued cards that could be the target, then you are not promised the order, only that you have the card clued somewhere in your hand.

They must be trying to send a deeper message.In this situation, they are trying to communicate that the focus of the clue should be inverted. The Play Clue is either on the left-most card (if it would normally be Chop Focus) or on the right-most card (if it would normally be the left-most card).Selfish Focus Inversion can only be performed with color clues.Selfish Focus Inversion takes precedence over an Out-of-Order Finesse. (This follows from Occam's Razor; if it could just be a normal Focus Inversion play clue, then it does not necessarily promise any blind-plays.)For example, in a 4-player game: It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a red 1 as a Play Clue.Bob clues blue to Alice as a Play Clue on a blue 1.Instead of playing her red 1, Cathy clues red to Donald, touching a red 3 on slot 1 and a red 2 on slot 2.

Thus, this cannot be a Selfish Finesse.Donald also knows that this cannot be a Self Finesse.

The other red card in his hand can be red 3, red 4, or red 5. Donald discards. Note that Selfish Focus Inversion is not allowed in variants with a rainbow or prism suit.

This is called a Blaze Discard because it \"ignites\" the next player's hand to fix the problem.For example, in a 3-player game: All 1's are played on the stacks.Alice discards a known red 2 as a Gentleman's Discard.Bob sees that Cathy's hand is completely unclued and is as follows, from left to right: red 1 (trash), red 2, green 1 (trash), green 1 (trash), blue 1 (trash)Bob knows that normally, the Gentleman's Discard promises that the other copy of the red 2 is on Finesse Position.

So, if Alice is not making a mistake, she must be trying to communicate something extra.Bob knows that this must be a Blaze Discard and he must blind-play the Finesse Position that matches the Finesse Position of the other card. In this case, since the red 2 is on Cathy's Second Finesse Position (slot 2), Bob must play his Second Finesse Position (slot 2).Bob blind-plays slot 2. It is a blue 2 and it successfully plays.From Cathy's perspective, she first suspects that some kind of Ejection is going on, since Bob blind-played his Second Finesse Position. However, since the previous action was a Gentleman's Discard, Alice knows that this must be a Blaze Discard. In other words, Bob was just blind-playing his Second Finesse Position to communicate to Cathy that she should play her Second Finesse Position instead of her First Finesse Position.Cathy blind-plays the red 2 from slot 2. Blaze Discards do not apply when someone discards a 1 and there are two copies remaining.

In these situations, one of the following is true: The discarding player is making a mistake (as a Wrong Prompt).The discarding player is not making a mistake and there is enough past context for the player with the cards to be able to tell the difference. Remember that Blaze Discards work with Finesse Positions, not with slot numbers.For example, in a 3-player game: Alice discards a red 3 as a Blaze Discard.Bob sees that Cathy has the other copy of the red 3. However, it is on slot 2 instead of on slot 1. (Cathy's hand is completely unclued.)

(Or, it could even be a Triple Gentleman's Discard.)For example, in a 3-player three suit game: It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.Alice clues number 1 to Bob, touching a 1 on slot 3.From everyone's perspective, this 1 could be any 1 in the game - blue 1, green 1, or yellow 1.Bob discards the card and it is revealed to be a blue 1.Cathy blind-plays her Finesse Position card, and it is a blue 1.Normally, Alice knows that Bob's discard would only promise the blue 1 (and not promise the green 1 or the yellow 1). However, since the game started on the turn before the clue was given, there is no possible way that Bob could have figured out the exact identity of the card in such a short amount of time.Thus, since Alice does not see the green 1 or the yellow 1 in other people's hands, Alice knows that she must have the green 1 and the yellow 1 on her Finesse Position and Second Finesse Position.

When such a Bluff occurs, it is called a Hard Bluff to disambiguate from situations where Bluffs happen with no ambiguity.For example, this is a Finesse + Prompt and not a Hard Bluff: Only red 1 is played on the stacks.Cathy has a 3 clued in her hand (with no color information on it).Alice clues Cathy about a brand new 4.Bob blind-plays red 2.In a normal Bluff, a one-away-from-playable card is clued. However, Cathy sees that the highest stack is the red stack, so the 4 in her hand must be two-away.Thus, Cathy does not read it as a Bluff; she is promised red 3 and red 4, so she plays the unknown 3 as a Self-Prompt for the red 3. For example, this is a Hard Bluff: Red 1 and blue 2 are played on the stacks.Cathy has a 3 clued in her hand (with no color information on it).Alice clues Cathy about a brand new 4.Bob blind-plays red 2.This could be a Bluff if the 4 in her hand is blue 4, since blue 4 is currently one-away-from-playable. Thus, Cathy does not assume that her 4 is red 4, and subsequently, does not assume that her unknown 3 is a red 3.

This is called a Sarcastic Discard, and it communicates to the other player that they 100% have the discarded card. (This is because normally, from Good Touch Principle, we never discard cards that have been clued, so if a player discards a clued card, something special must be going on.)For example, in a 3-player game: On the stacks, red 2 is played.Alice has one red 3 clued in his hand with just number 3.Alice clues number 3 to Bob, which touches one 3.

We agree that it means that the cards to the right of the trash are important.

Most of the time, the Trash Chop Move is done for a single card (meaning that the trash card that was clued was one-away from chop). However, you can also use the Trash Chop Move to Chop Move multiple cards. For example, in a 3-player game: All of the 1's have been played on the stacks.Bob has a completely unclued hand.Alice clues 1's to Bob, which touches a 1 in his slot 1.Bob Chop Moves his slot 2, his slot 3, his slot 4, and his slot 5 (a quadruple Chop Move).Bob discards the 1.Bob's chop is now his slot 1. This move is most commonly done with a number 1 clue because it is likely that in the middle of a game, all of the 1's will be already played. But it could also be done with a number two 2 clue if all the 2's are already played / accounted for. Or, it could be done with a red clue if all of the red cards are already played / accounted for. And so forth.Strategy wise, the Trash Chop Move is used for two main reasons: 1) Sometimes there are multiple critical cards in a row on chop and it falls to one player to save all of them. In this situation, a multiple-card Chop Move could be the only way to do it. 2) Some cards (e.g. a one-away-from-playable 3) are quite useful to the team, but \"illegal\" to touch directly (as touching them directly with a clue would imply that they are playable right now). If the game is going well, then it can be useful to \"waste\" a clue in order to have the card saved permanently.Note that you are not allowed to Trash Chop Move a card that you can just clue directly with a Save Clue (unless there are multiple critical cards in a row on chop and you have no other choice). This is because having some positive information is always better than having the card be a mystery.If a Trash Chop Move touches multiple trash cards, then it only Chop Moves the cards to the right of the right-most trash card. For example, in a 3-player game: All the 1's are played on the stacks.Bob has a completely unclued hand.Alice clues 1's to Bob, which touches a 1 in slot 2 and a 1 in slot 4.Bob only Chop Moves his slot 5 card.

Thus, if you clue a 5 and it is two (or more) slots away from the chop, then it is to be assumed to be a Play Clue on the 5. When counting how far away from chop a card is, you should only look at unclued cards. Similar to the Trash Chop Move, if a 5's Chop Move touches multiple 5's, then it only Chop Moves the cards to the right of the right-most 5. For example, in a 3-player game: All the 1's are played on the stacks.Bob has a completely unclued hand.Alice clues 5's to Bob, which touches a 5 in slot 2 and a 5 in slot 4.Bob only Chop Moves his slot 5 card. Bob's new chop is his slot 3. Remember that 5 Stalls takes precedence over 5's Chop Moves. Thus, if a number 5 clue could just be a 5 Stall (e.g. it is the Early Game), then it should not Chop Move anything.

The exception to this is if a clue is given that touches a Chop Moved card for the first time and only \"old\" cards are touched.For example, in a 3-player game of the rainbow variant: All the 2's are played on the stacks.Bob has an unknown red card on slot 3, an unknown red card on slot 4, and a Chop Moved card in slot 5 (that is completely unclued).Alice clues blue to Bob, which touches slot 3, slot 4, and slot 5. (Slot 3 and slot 4 are \"filled in\" to be rainbow cards and slot 5 is now a true blue card.)Bob knows that the focus of the clue is normally on the brand-new card introduced, but all three of the cards that were touched were \"old\".Bob knows that when old cards are re-touched, the focus of the clue is the left-most of those cards.However, Bob also knows that in this is the exception to the rule. In this specific case, putting a positive clue on the Chop Moved card was more important than filling in the rainbow cards, so by convention the focus of the clue is his slot 5.

(On Hanab Live, this is usually represented as a player writing an \"identity note\" on the card.)For example, in a 3-player no variant game: It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.Alice clues Bob red, touching a red card on slot 1 as a Play Clue.Bob immediately right-clicks on the card and writes a note of \"red 1\".This card is now \"locked in\" as a red 1. No future clues or actions from other players can ever change that. Information Lock with a Superposition# A superposition is a term from quantum mechanics that describes how something can be two different things at the same time. For example, an electron is a type of a particle, and an electron can either be \"spin up\" or \"spin down\". But an electron could also be in a superposition of both \"spin up\" and \"spin down\" at the same time, as weird as that sounds. Eventually, if the electron happens to bounces off of something (e.g. is measured), then the superposition will \"collapse\" and it will only be in a \"spin up\" or \"spin down\" state. The details of quantum mechanics are not important - the main point is that we treat unknown Hanabi cards sort of like unknown particles: even though they really have a true identity, we ignore that and treat them as being all of the possibilities at the same time.As soon as a clue is given to a card that could be two or more different things, then the assumed superposition of all of the possibilities is locked in to the card.For example, in 3-player rainbow game: It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.Alice clues Bob red, touching a red card on slot 1 as a Play Clue.Bob immediately right-clicks on the card and writes a note\" of \"red 1 or rainbow 1\".This card is now \"locked in\" as this specific superposition. Future clues and actions can narrow down the cards in the superposition or completely collapse the superposition, but new cards can never be added to the superposition. Information Lock on In-Between Cards# As soon as a clue is given to a card that is not immediately playable, the assumed identity is locked in to the card and all of the in-between cards.For example, in a 4-player no variant game: Red 1 is played on the stacks.Bob has one card in his hand clued with number 2. (It is currently unknown.)Cathy has one card in her hand clued with number 3. (It is currently unknown.)Alice clues Donald red, touching a red 4 as a Play Clue.Bob is promised to have the red 2. He writes a note of \"red 2\" on his clued 2. It is now locked in forever as that card.Cathy is promised to have the red 3. She writes a note of \"red 3\" on her clued 3. It is now locked in forever as that card.Donald knows that from Good Touch Principle, his red card cannot be red 2, since Bob has that card clued in his hand.Donald knows that from Good Touch Principle, his red card cannot be red 3, since Cathy has that card clued in her hand.Donald knows that he must therefore have the red 4. He writes a note of \"red 4\" on his red card. It is now locked in forever as that card. Breaking Information Lock# A direct conflict is the only thing that can \"break\" an information lock.For example, in a 3-player game: Bob has a card in his hand that is touched with a number 2 clue. (It has no color clues on it.)Bob has a written a note of \"red 2\" on the card, meaning that it has been \"locked in\" as a red 2. (Bob will permanently think that it is a red 2.)Alice clues blue to Bob, which \"fills in\" the card as a blue 2.It is now impossible for this card to be a red 2 - Bob knows that he was lied to earlier on in the game. Bob erases his note of \"red 2\" on the card and the Information Lock is broken.

This means that players will generally try to \"get\" as many cards with one clue as possible.If you use one clue to get one card, we refer to that as a 1-for-1 clue. For example: On the first turn of the game, Alice clues Bob number 1, touching one 1 as a 1-for-1. If you use one clue to get two cards, we refer to that as a 2-for-1 clue. For example: On the first turn of the game, Alice clues Bob number 1, touching two 1's as a 2-for-1. (Bob will play both.) 3-for-1 clues are even better than 2-for-1 clues, and so forth. It is even possible to perform a 9-for-1 clue with advanced techniques.If a clue touches two cards but only one of them will play right now, it still counts as a 2-for-1. This is because we assume that all touched cards will eventually play from Good Touch Principle. For example: On the first turn of the game, Alice clues Bob red, touching a red 1 on slot 1 and a red 5 on slot 2 as a 2-for-1. (Bob will only play the red 1 and save the other red card for later.) On Hanab Live, the future required efficiency is shown on the right side of the screen. Future required efficiency is calculated by the following formula: number of cards that remain to be clued / number of clues remaining If future required efficiency is high, players should probably not perform 1-for-1 clues! Instead, it is better to discard and try to let someone perform a Finesse.

(This is similar to how it is used in other games such as chess.)Hanabi can be thought of a race to get all the cards played before the time runs out. This means that even if the team is being extremely efficient, they can still lose the game if they are not playing their cards fast enough. Thus, players have to strike a balance between Efficiency and Tempo. You can think of Efficiency and Tempo as the yin and yang of Hanabi.At the beginning of the game, there is a lot of time left, so players will generally prefer clues that get a lot of efficiency over clues that get a lot of tempo.At the end of the game, there is almost no time left, so players stop caring about efficiency and start caring only about tempo.On Hanab Live, \"Pace\" is shown at the right side of the screen. Pace is a measure of how many more discards can occur, so this essentially tells you how much time is left in the game. Starting pace is calculated by the following formula: current score + cards in deck + number of players - maximum score Even at the beginning of the game, players might prefer a clue that gets tempo over a more efficient clue if it will prevent the discard of some other useful card.

If a player has unknown 1's and does not play them in the correct order, it means that they are trying to send an additional message.If a player skips over one of the 1's, and there is nothing else special going on, it means that the next player should Chop Move one card.If a player skips over two of the 1s, the message skips over the next player, and the player after that should Chop Move one card.A skip of three 1's means that the player three seats away should Chop Move, and so on.For example, in a 3-player game: It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.Alice clues Bob number 1, which touches three 1's.

However, sometimes you may not have a clue at all. One way to solve this situation is with a special kind of discard.Typically, discarding is a last resort. So, if you have a known playable card in your hand, you can send a powerful message to your teammate by discarding a card instead. This is called a Scream Discard. Since your teammate expected you to play, it is like screaming at them to let them know that things are very bad.A Scream Discard does two things: 1) The player being \"screamed at\" should permanently move their chop by one position. 2) The player being \"screamed at\" is not allowed to discard on this turn. Instead, they must give a clue. If there are no normal Play Clues or Save Clues to give, then they are allowed to give \"stall\" clues, like a 5 Stall. If there are no 5 Stalls to give, they can even just \"fill-in\" some information on an already-clued card (and doing this should not cause a Finesse).Players are only allowed to Scream Discard for cards that are playable or critical (or a needed 2 that isn't seen anywhere else). (This follows from Save Principle.)Players are only allowed to Scream Discard as an absolute last resort. This means Scream Discards are almost always performed while the team is at 0 clues. (Less commonly, they can also be performed if the team is at 1 clue and the next person happens to be Locked.)Players are not allowed to Scream Discard for cards that are one-away-from-playable.Players are not allowed to Scream Discard if there was some other, less dangerous way to save the card. It is a \"last resort\" move.Sometimes, a player will discard with a known-playable card in their hand, but they are not intending a Scream Discard - it is some other special situation: 1) It is not a Scream Discard if the next player has to generate a clue for cluing the next player after that. This is called a Generation Discard; see below. 2) It is not a Scream Discard when the card that the player did not play was a \"blind\" card from a Finesse and the blind card could also be in the next player's Finesse Position.

Thus, the discard is just for the purposes of generating a clue so that player 2 can clue player 3.The Generation Discard is only to be used as a last resort.

If it is low-value or useless, then you should give the clue and let them discard.\"Stealing\" clues in this way is called Discard Modulation. If other players are discarding to let you give all of the clues, you probably have a high-value chop.For example, in a 3-player game: All the 1's are played on the stacks except for the red 1.It is the Early Game.Alice plays the red 1 from her hand. (It was clued earlier with a Play Clue.)Bob sees that from Alice's perspective, there is nothing in Cathy's hand to clue.Cathy has a red 3 on chop. This is a one-away-from-playable card that is valuable to the team. However, it would be illegal to clue the card directly with a Play Clue or a Save Clue.Alice has a red 5 on chop. According to the Early Game rules, someone must clue the 5 before ending the Early Game. However, Bob knows that as an exception, it is not required to clue the person who came immediately before you. When Alice played the red 1 and did not see anything for Bob to do, Alice was giving permission to Bob to discard.Bob decides to discard instead of saving the 5 in Alice's hand.Cathy clues number 5 to Alice as a 5 Save.Bob has smartly prevented the discard of the red 3, at least for a little while. This kind of strategy is called Discard Modulation. For example, in a 3-player game (a similar situation): All the 1's are played on the stacks except for the red 1.It is the Early Game.Alice plays the red 1 from her hand. (It was clued earlier with a Play Clue.)Bob sees that from Alice's perspective, there is nothing in Cathy's hand to clue.Cathy has a red 1 on chop. This is a trash card.Alice has a red 5 on chop. According to the Early Game rules, someone must clue the 5 before ending the Early Game. However, Bob knows that as an exception, it is not required to clue the person who came immediately before you. When Alice played the red 1 and did not see anything for Bob to do, Alice was giving permission to Bob to discard.Bob decides to ignore the exception and save the 5 in Alice's hand anyway.Cathy discards the red 1.Bob has smartly orchestrated a line in which a useless card was discarded. This kind of strategy is called Discard Modulation.

However, sometimes we still want to \"save\" these cards. Thus, they are prime targets for indirect saves like the Trash Chop Move or the 5's Chop Move.However, in most cases, Chop Moving the valuable card just won't be possible. So in general, you should try to construct lines that protect high-value cards from being discarded for as long as possible. "},{"title":"Blind-Playing Chop Moved Cards","type":1,"pageTitle":"Level 5 - Proselyte","url":"docs/level_5#blind-playing-chop-moved-cards","content":"Often times, cards are Chop Moved towards the beginning of the game. Normally, once the time comes, the Chop Moved card will be clued directly in order to get it to play.However, other times, the Chop Moved card will sit there and will never be clued. As the game progresses towards the end, the player with the Chop Moved card will learn more and more information about it. For example, they might accumulate a lot of negative clues on the card. Or, they might deduce that it is probably not any of the cards that are already played (which drastically reduces the possibilities towards the end of the game).A clever player who accumulates enough information about a Chop Moved card may determine that all of the possibilities for the card are playable. In this situation, they do not have to wait for their teammates to clue the card directly - they can simply blind-play the Chop Moved card and it will work, regardless of which exact card it is.Blind-playing cards in this manner is risky! It is fairly common for players to forgo cluing Chop Moved cards directly in favor of using the other copy of the card in someone else's hand. (For example, it may be more efficient to use the non-Chop Moved copy if it would be a 2-for-1 clue instead of a 1-for-1 clue.) Thus, there is always the chance that blind-playing a Chop Moved card in this manner will get a strike for the team (in the case where the other copy was used or in the case where the Chop Move was a mistake).For this reason, clever players should try to blind-play their Chop Moved cards if they have a pretty good chance of being playable, but only if the team has one or more strikes to spare.Subsequently, players should not clue a now-useless Chop Moved card to prevent a future strike. The typical strategy is to just let it be Chop Moved for the rest of the game: In the best case scenario, the Chop Moved player will naturally figure out that the card is trash and can safely discard it. Or, alternatively, they will keep the card Chop Moved, but continue to discard other useless cards from their chop until the end of the game.In the worst case scenario, the Chop Moved player will try to blind-play the card and get a strike for the team. But this is not guaranteed, and even if they do, they will only do it if there is a strike to spare.

Similarly, it is possible to get a single player to blind-play 2 cards in a row.

This is more complicated than a normal Finesse and is harder to see. (e.g. clue --> clued player does unrelated action --> blind-play --> clued-card plays)Because Reverse Finesses exist as a strategy, before playing any cards, players should always check out everyone's Finesse Position. If a card in someone's Finesse Position is playable and \"matches\" the clue, then they need to defer playing the clued card for at least one go-around and wait to see what happens.If the player with the \"matching\" card blind-plays it, then it means that the clued card is the next card in the chain. For example, in a 3-player game: It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.Alice clues Bob red, which touches his red 2.Next, it is Bob's turn. Normally, Bob would think that he had the red 1, and play it immediately.However, Bob also notices that on Cathy has a red 1 on her slot 1 position.

It is red 2 and successfully plays.Cathy now knows that her 3 must match the 2, so she marks her 3 as red 3. Note that Self-Finesses can be difficult to perform because the player receiving the clue will only consider the possibility of a Self-Finesse if there are no other possibilities for the clue. For example: If the clue looks like it could just be a normal/direct Play Clue on a card, then the clue receiver will not blind-play anything - they will just play the card that was clued.If the clue looks like it could be a Prompt, then the clue receiver will not play anything and assume that it is a Prompt.

Cards are not normally duplicated (which follows from Good Touch Principle), but sometimes someone makes a mistake, or a sequence of particular cards makes duplicating necessary. Duplicate cards will lead to misplays, so it is the team's responsibility to fix the problem and intervene before this happens.  In the above screenshot: Before the clue was given, Alice had an unknown purple card in her hand.From Good Touch Principle, Alice concluded that her card must be purple 5, and had planned to play it as soon as possible.Bob clues number 3 to Alice, which \"fills in\" the purple card and reveals that it is purple 3.Since Alice was just about to play this card, Alice knows that this was a Fix Clue and that she can now safely discard the purple 3.  A clue cannot be a Play Clue and a Fix Clue at the same time. If you receive a Fix Clue and it touches other ancillary cards, none of them are necessarily playable; the primary point of the clue is to fix the impending misplay.In the above screenshot: Before the clue was given, Alice has an unknown 1 in her hand.From Good Touch Principle, Alice concluded that her 1 must be green 1, and had planned to play it as soon as possible.Bob clues blue to Alice, which \"fills in\" the 1 and reveals that it is blue 1. The blue clue also touches a blue card on slot 1.In this situation, Alice might be tempted to think that this is a Play Clue on a blue 2 in slot 1, especially considering that the slot 1 card was the only brand new card introduced in the clue (and that the focus of a clue should always be on the brand new card introduced).However, the fact that the blue clue \"fixed\" an impending misplay means that Bob may have had no choice but to clue blue, and he may not necessarily be trying to give a Play Clue.Alice marks the blue card as either blue 2, blue 3, blue 4, or blue 5, and discards the blue 1.

Since he was going to play the 1 already without Alice doing anything, the clue must have some other meaning. Thus, it is a Fix Clue: the remaining 1 is bad, and Bob can safely discard it. Note that in general, giving a Fix Clue should wait until the card is actually in danger of being misplayed (like in the previous example). If a duplicated card is not in danger of being misplayed anytime soon, then players should defer giving the Fix Clue until later. This way, it gives the player a chance to figure out the duplication on their own, which can happen from time to time.Fix Clues that give no additional information only \"fix\" one card. For example: Alice clues Bob number 1 and it touches three 1's.Bob successfully plays one 1.Before Bob can play the 2nd 1, Alice clues Bob number 1 again, and all the clue does is re-touch the two remaining 1's.Now it is Bob's turn.

This is to be avoided at all costs and players should play relatively conservatively when the team is at two strikes. (One exception is when players are explicitly going for a perfect score in a really tough variant, but this is less common.)Building on this concept, it can also be very bad to get two strikes in a row. For example, say that Alice performs a bad clue and Bob misplays, causing a strike. And then Cathy \"still believes\" the original clue (thinking that Bob was the one who made the mistake instead of Alice), and Cathy goes on to misplay, causing yet another strike.So, in general, we want to isolate one mistake to one strike. Why? Since Hanabi is so difficult, mistakes are common, and we don't want to push the team to the precipice of failure after one tiny mistake. That kind of thing is not very good for the overall win-rate.This means that when a strike happens, the state of information should \"reset\" back to what it was before the mistake happened, at least most of the time.For example, if Alice clues red to Cathy, and Bob misplays a card, then Cathy should not go on to play any of her red cards, and Cathy should not make any assumptions about what her red cards could be.

Bob also has a completely unclued hand. Bob discards his chop and it is the other copy of the red 4.Since both copies of the red 4 are discarded, it is no longer possible to get a perfect score. (The maximum score now is 23 instead of 25.)Normally, someone on the team would give a Save Clue to Bob's red 4 before it could get discarded. But since Bob's turn was immediately after Alice's turn, no-one on the team had time to save it. In the above example, on Bob's turn, since Bob could have the red 4 on his chop, we would say that Bob is in a Double Discard Situation for the red 4.More formally, a Double Discard Situation is defined as when the previous player discards or misplays an unplayed card and the current player could be discarding the other copy of that card.Players agree to never discard in a Double Discard Situation if it has the potential to lower the maximum score. Instead, they must give some clue. If there are no normal Play Clues or Save Clues to give, then they are allowed to give \"stall\" clues, like a 5 Stall. If there are no 5 Stalls to give, they can even just \"fill-in\" some information on an already-clued card (and doing this should not cause a Finesse).Let's revisit the above example to show what Bob should have done: Alice has nothing to do. Alice discards her chop and it is a red 4.Bob has nothing to do (meaning that there are no normal Play Clues or Save Clues to give). Bob also has a completely unclued hand.Bob's chop is his slot 5 card. Since Bob does not see the red 4 in anyone else's hand and Bob's slot 5 card has no positive or negative clues on it, it is possible that Bob's slot 5 card could be the red 4. Thus, Bob knows that he is currently in a Double Discard Situation for the red 4.Since there are no normal Play Clues or Save Clues available, Bob looks around to see if he can give a 5 Stall. Bob sees that Cathy has a red 5 on her slot 1, so he clues number 5 to Cathy as a 5 Stall.Cathy knows that since Bob was in a Double Discard Situation for the red 4, she should not read too closely into his clues.

In that case, you can still do the Finesse - they will play the Prompted card, see that it wasn't the card you had intended, and then blind-play their 2nd newest card on the next turn.

This is extremely important, because it resynchronizes the information among the team. So, as a group, we agree to blind-play our cards as soon as reasonably possible. This is called The Urgency Principle.Thus, if you see that a player does not blind-play into the Finesse, then you know that the Finesse must be on you.However, there are some important exceptions: 1) Players are allowed to defer playing into a Finesse if they are doing a Finesse of their own (and no-one else on the team could have done it). 2) Players are allowed to defer playing into a Finesse if they are doing something really important, like saving a 5 on chop, giving a Play Clue to a card that is about to be discarded, or something along those lines.So, if any of the above two conditions apply, then you have to wait and give the player yet another turn to demonstrate whether or not they will blind-play.For example, in a 5-player game: All of the 1's are played on the stacks.There is 1 clue in the bank.Alice clues red to Emily, touching a red 3 as a Play Clue. This is a Finesse on the red 2.Bob sees that the Finesse is on Cathy. (Cathy has the red 2 in her Finesse Position.) Since the team is at 0 clues, Bob discards.Cathy's knows that Alice is performing a Finesse and that she must have the red 2. Cathy's first instinct is to blind-play the red 2. This is urgent because otherwise, Emily will think that her red card might be the red 2, and it would misplay.However, Cathy also sees that Donald has a blue 5 on chop that needs to be saved. Furthermore, from Cathy's perspective, Donald could discard on his turn, so the blue 5 is in imminent danger. If Cathy blind-plays into the Finesse, then the blue 5 might get discarded.Instead of blind-playing into the Finesse, Cathy clues number 5 to Donald as a 5 Save.Since the team is at 0 clues, Donald discards.After Alice's clue, Emily marked her red card as \"red 2 or red 3 if Cathy blind-plays red 2\". However, even though Cathy did not blind-play the red 2, Emily could see that Cathy was doing an important, time-sensitive action to prevent the team from losing the game. Thus, Emily knows that she needs to give Cathy another chance to blind-play the red 2. If Cathy does not blind-play the red 2 on her next turn (and nothing else special is going on), then Emily can play her own red card as the red 2.

For example: In a no-variant game, a red Play Clue might indicate a red 2 or a red 3 depending on whether or not red 2 will blind-play from someone else's hand.In a rainbow-game, a red clue might indicate either a Play Clue on a red 1 or a Delayed Play Clue on a rainbow 2 through another player's yet-to-be-played rainbow 1. After getting a clue, you should immediately mark all of the possibilities down on the card as a note.For all of your subsequent turns, you have to treat that card like it is all of the possibilities at the same time. This is a lot like the Schrödinger's Cat quantum physics analogy, which states a cat is both alive and dead at the same time, and you won't know until you actually open the box and look. Similarly, treat the unknown card as all the possibilities at the same time, and you won't actually know until the card is played.The implications of Schrödinger's Cat Principle is that players must be very careful. Before playing a card, they will often have to wait for everyone else to have a turn to allow for the possibility of a Prompt, Reverse Finesse, and so forth.

Another way of saying this is that Clandestine Finesses have a Misplay Component; if the blind-player does not continue to blind-play cards, then the clue receiver will go on to misplay the \"matching\" card.A similar situation can also happen when a rank clue \"matches\" the card from a blind-play, but the clue receiver sees non-matching rank cards in the blind-player's hand that are currently playable.If the clue receiver waits for these non-matching cards to blind-play, and they do blind-play, then it means that the original clue was on a different suit than it first appeared. This is called a Surreptitious Self-Finesse in order to disambiguate it from a more ordinary Clandestine Finesse.Surreptitious Finesses have a Misplay Component in almost the exact same way that Clandestine Finesses do, but they just involve non-matching rank cards.Generally speaking, this means that when a rank clue initiates a Finesse, the clue receiver must always allow for the possibility that subsequent non-matching rank cards in the blind-player's hand (that are of a lower rank than the clue) can possibly be caught up in the Finesse.For example, in a 3-player game: Red 1 is played on the stacks.Alice clues number 3 to Cathy, which touches one 3.Bob blind-plays red 2.Cathy knows that red 2 \"matches\" number 3, so she knows that she probably has red 3.However, Cathy also sees that before Bob blind-played the red 2, he had a blue 1 in the slot right after it.Thus, it is possible for Cathy's 3 to actually be blue 3. If it is, Bob will blind-play the blue 1 and Cathy will know that she has blue 2 on her Finesse Position.So, Cathy discards (instead of potentially playing the red 3 on this turn) to allow for the possibility of a Surreptitious Finesse.

Thus, it is extremely rare that a player would decline to perform one if it was possible to do so.If a player declines to perform a Priority Finesse, and there is nothing else special going on, then they must be trying to communicate something extra.They are instead calling for a Priority Finesse on the card that had Priority. This is called an Inverted Priority Finesse because it gets a blind-play from playing a card with Priority (as opposed to getting a blind-play from playing a card without Priority).After a Inverted Priority Finesse occurs, the presence of a normal Priority Finesse is now known to everyone on the team. Thus, the normal Priority Finesse is preserved and should be played into on the next go-around of the table.For example, in a 3-player game: Alice has a choice between playing a red 1 and a blue 2. Both cards are fully known, and no-one else has any clued cards, so the red 1 has Priority.Alice plays the red 1.Bob sees that if Alice had played the blue 2, she could have performed a Priority Finesse on Cathy's slot 1 card, the blue 3.Bob knows that there was no reason for Alice to decline the Priority Finesse, so this must be an Inverted Priority Finesse. Bob blind-plays his slot 1 card, and it is the red 2.Cathy knows that the red 1 had Priority, so playing it should not have caused Bob to blind-play anything. Thus, Cathy knows that this must be an Inverted Priority Finesse, and she knows that she has a blue 3 on her slot 1. Cathy discards.Alice plays blue 2.Bob discards.Cathy blind-plays blue 3. Note that Inverted Priority Finesse will only work if the players are in a certain order. Otherwise, the player holding the declined priority card can Play Clue the other card, which would destroy the information channel.

This is called a Shadow Finesse because the positional blind-play is a \"shadow\" of the card that could have been used for the normal Finesse.The first card to blind-play is called the shadow and the second card to blind-play is called the shadow target.For example, in a 4-player game: It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.Alice clues number 1 to Cathy, touching a single red 1 on slot 1 as a Play Clue.Bob sees that Alice's clue is very strange: Donald has a red 2 on his slot 4. Alice could have instead clued red to Donald to Finesse Cathy's red 1.Bob sees no other explanation for this, so he knows that this must be a Shadow Finesse - Bob must hold the red 2's \"shadow\".Since the red 2 is in Donald's Fourth Finesse Position (slot 4), Bob immediately plays his Fourth Finesse Position (slot 4). It is a blue 1 and it successfully plays.Cathy can see all of the other hands and understands Alice's clue. Cathy plays the clued red 1.Donald is very surprised to see Bob play his Fourth Finesse Position. The only thing that could cause this is a Shadow Finesse.Donald blind-plays the red 2 (the shadow target) from his slot 4. The shadow in a Shadow Finesse must exist in the immediate next player's hand, similar to a Bluff. And the player holding the shadow must blind-play it immediately to resynchronize the team, similar to a Bluff.Once a shadow has been blind-played, the team should consider the shadow target as being fully known and \"touched\". (In other words, it no longer occupies a Finesse Position.)Remember that Shadow Finesses work with Finesse Positions, not with slot numbers.Care should be taken to not give a Shadow Finesse that could be misinterpreted as some other kind of move. For example: If the shadow is on the First Finesse Position, then the move might be misinterpreted as a Bluff or a Trash Finesse.If the shadow is on the Second Finesse Position, then the move might be misinterpreted as a 5 Color EjectionIf the shadow is on the Third Finesse Position, then the move might be misinterpreted as an Unknown Trash Discharge. The shadow must come before the shadow target.

As an intermediate player, you need to know about a few extra rules about the Early Game. We don't bother telling the extra rules to beginners because they deal with some edge-case situations. We have the extra rules in place because we want to \"squeeze\" as much value out of the conventions as possible. Ending the Early Game# The Early Game is only ended when the first completely unknown card is discarded.In other words: Misplaying a card does not count as ending the Early Game.Discarding known trash does not count as ending the Early Game.Doing special discards that \"transfer\" cards to other players does not count as ending the Early Game. Extinguishing Every Clue# Extinguishing every clue does include 5 Stalling, but it is only mandatory for the team to collectively perform one 5 Stall. If one 5 Stall clue has already been given and there is another 5 Stall clue available, players are allowed to clue it if they want, but they don't have to.Extinguishing every clue does not include giving Tempo Clues (e.g. clues that do not meet Minimum Clue Value Principle).Extinguishing every clue does not include cluing something in the hand of the player who came directly before. This is because the player who came before did not see anything for the next player to do, and is therefore giving them \"permission\" to discard. In this situation, cluing is optional; players can choose to either clue the previous hand or discard at their discretion.Extinguishing every clue does not include cluing cards that will be almost certainly be Order Chop Moved by an upcoming player who already has two or more 1's clued in their hand.

Less commonly, they can also be performed in the Mid-Game if a player happens to be in a special \"stalling\" situation where they are not allowed to discard.In the Early Game, the team can give as many 5 Stalls as they want before initiating the Mid-Game.Regardless of whether they are done in the Early Game or the Mid-Game, 5 Stalls are only allowed if there is nothing else \"normal\" to do (like playing a card, giving a normal Play Clue, or giving a normal Save Clue). However, as an exception, players are also allowed to 5 Stall if there is only one Play Clue remaining and it would touch a card that someone else on the team could conceivably Finesse. (We refer to this as the Finesse Position Exception, or FPE.)The Finesse Position Exception also applies if the same card is in multiple Finesse Positions and there is nothing else to do.The Finesse Position Exception applies whenever a player performs a 5 Stall, regardless of whether it is in the Early Game or not. 5 Stalls cannot be given in the Mid-Game if there are any playable 5's. In this situation, a number 5 clue would just look like a Play Clue on the 5.5 Stalls must be given to the 5 that is closest to chop. For example, in a 3-player game: It is the Early Game. The only thing left for Alice to do is to clue an off-chop 5.Bob has two playable 1's on slots 1 and 2. He has a 5 on slot 4. Bob's 5 is therefore one-away from chop.Cathy has nothing clued in her hand. She has a 5 on slot 3.

What is the point of having a complicated table with defined priorities? Well, normally, players in stalling situations are not able to give tricky-looking Finesses, because everyone else on the team will think that they are giving a stall clue. However, if it can be seen that there is a better clue available for them to give, then everyone can know that they are not giving a stall clue.

Similar to a Double Discard situation, players should not read too closely into any clues given during this state.If the team is out of clues and someone's hand is fully clued, then you have to discard to generate a clue for them.

Often times, doing a Gentleman's Discard will delay things and cost the team Tempo. Thus, a Gentleman's Discard that slows things down is only good if there is some other side benefit to offset the lost Tempo (such as delaying the discard of a valuable card, for example).Just like how Prompts take precedence over Finesses, Sarcastic Discards take precedence over Gentleman's Discards.For the purposes of Priority, Gentleman's Discards do not count as a blind-play.

It makes sense to transfer a card out of a locked / almost locked hand to a player with an \"empty\" hand or a hand that only has one card clued in it. 2) You want to protect your own chop. If you discard your chop, the team could be losing some high-value one-away-from-playable card. But if you transfer a card to someone else, it gives you something \"safe\" to do.

In this situation, Cathy is expected to perform a Sarcastic Discard. Doing a Finesse that potentially duplicates a card in this way is called a Sarcastic Finesse. Normally, potentially duplicating a card is bad - it violates Good Touch Principle and could lead to a clue being wasted. However, potentially duplicating a card with the Sarcastic Finesse is not bad because: In the best case, you get a \"true\" Finesse (a 2-for-1 or better).In the worst case, you get a 1-for-1 and full knowledge on a clued card in your own hand that was previously a mystery.

This is called a Certain Discard, because Cathy can be certain that it is exactly red 3.A separate way to explain this convention is that everyone agrees that performing a Layered Finesse on a card that could potentially be clued in your own hand is illegal. So, everyone can be certain that they can safely blind discard a card to pass it back to someone who potentially duplicated. (Layered Finesses are an advanced type of Finesse that was explained above.)Note that players are only allowed to do a Certain Discard if they know they have not been Bluffed.

Or, you may have the impression that the conventions are like laws and that you must always follow them. Neither of these things are true.Context is defined as all of the meta-information about the game state. In intermediate and expert games, when determining what a clue means, players must always take into account the full context of the game. This means that figuring out what a clue means is never truly as easy as following one of the flowcharts listed on the website.When writing the strategy documentation, it would be distracting to constantly write the word \"probably\" and to constantly write \"this may not apply in all situations\" all over the place. For advanced players, this is obvious - Hanabi is complicated enough such that every convention is meant to be broken if the particular situation demands it.Thus, players need to read the reference documentation with a grain of salt, especially when it says the word \"always\". Even though this website outlines the \"correct\" thing to do in a lot of situations, these are not hard and fast rules. Rather, they are intended to show the \"default\" or \"common\" case. Memorizing the default cases is really helpful, for intermediate and advanced players alike. But players have to always remember to keep their brain fully engaged on the particular situation.

Does this mean that the Gentleman's Discard \"gets\" both of the cards?No, it does not. By convention, even if it looks like the player could not have known the true identity of the card, the Gentleman's Discard only gets the specific other matching card. (The reason for this is that it allows players to act upon asymmetric information.)For example, in a 3-player game: Red 1 and blue 1 are played on the stacks.Alice clues Bob number 2, which touches a red 2 on slot 1. This is a Play Clue on the 2. Thus, this is a globally known red 2 or blue 2. Alice right-clicks the card and writes a note of \"r2, b2\".Bob also writes a note of \"r2, b2\", but then stops to think a little deeper. He notices that Alice has a blue 3 in her hand, so it might have been possible for Cathy to perform a Finesse on a hypothetical blue 2 in his hand.Bob rewinds to the beginning of the game and re-plays through all of the turns, watching closely to see if Cathy had an ample opportunity to perform a Finesse on a blue 2. Indeed, he finds that Cathy had one or two turns where she could have easily performed a Reverse Finesse, but discarded instead.Thus, Bob knows that it must be a red 2, so he updates his \"r2, b2\" note to \"r2\".Bob sees that Cathy has a red 2 on her Finesse Position, so he performs a Gentleman's Discard by discarding the red 2.Cathy blind-plays the red 2 from her Finesse Position.Alice gasps in surprise, because Bob could not have possibly known that it was exactly a red 2. This must be a Double Gentleman's Discard, calling for both red 2 and blue 2. Alice blind-plays her Finesse Position card, hoping to play a blue 2, but instead plays a red 5, losing the game.Alice forgot that Double Gentleman's Discards were expressly illegal because it is possible for players to have asymmetric information about the current game state.

So, when you see a playable card in someone's Finesse Position slot, you will often want to \"get\" the card with a Finesse (instead of cluing it directly). However, often times, the proper \"connecting\" card is not on the table.In this situation, you can perform an alternate strategy by fibbing to the next player. By cluing an unrelated, one-away-from-playable card, the next player will think that it is a Finesse and that they have the matching card. Then, they will blind-play their Finesse Position card. This is called a Bluff.After the card is blind-played, the player who received the clue will realize that something strange has happened - the type of clue did not match the card that was blind-played. Thus, the clued card is not currently playable and must be a one-away-from-playable card.For example, in a 3-player game: All the 2's are played on the stacks.Alice clues Cathy red, which touches a red 4 as a Play Clue.Next, it is Bob's turn. Bob sees that, with this red clue, Cathy has just been signaled that she has the red 3.From Bob's perspective, this looks like a Finesse - if Bob does not blind-play the red 3 right now, Cathy will go on to misplay the red 4 as the red 3.Bob blind-plays his slot 1 card, expecting it to be a red 3. Instead, it is a blue 3, and it successfully plays on the stacks. Bob now knows that he was Bluffed by Alice.Next, Cathy sees that Bob just blind-played a blue 3 immediately after this red clue, so she knows that she must have a one-away-from-playable red card - the red 4. Cathy holds on to the red 4 for later and discards. Except in rare circumstances, Bluffing is only permissible when you are the person directly before the player who is blind-playing a card.

How does everyone know whether Alice did a Finesse or a Bluff on Bob?The way to find out is to look at whether the card that blind-played \"matches\" the clue that was given. If the clue matches, then it is a Finesse. If the clue did not match, then it is a Bluff.If it is ambiguous whether or not the card matches, then the team should assume a Bluff over a Finesse. (Note that this is the opposite of the precedence in part 1!)Example 1 (color match): Red 1 is played on the stacks.Alice clues Cathy red, touching a red card as a Play Clue.Bob blind-plays a red 2.This must be a Finesse, because red matches red. So Cathy should think that she has the red 3.This is a textbook Finesse; it can't get any more basic than this. Example 2 (color mismatch): Red 1 is played on the stacks.Alice clues Cathy red, touching a red card as a Play Clue.Bob blind-plays a blue 1.This must be a Bluff, because blue does not match red. So Cathy should think that she has the one-away-from-playable red card, the red 3.This is a textbook Bluff; it can't get any more basic than this. Example 3 (rank match): Red 2 is played on the stacks.Alice clues Cathy number 4, touching a 4 as a Play Clue.Bob blind-plays the red 3.This must be a Finesse, because 3 matches 4. So Cathy should think that she has the red 4. Example 4 (rank mismatch): Red 2 is played on the stacks.Alice clues Cathy number 4, touching a 4 as a Play Clue.Bob blind-plays the blue 1.This could be a Triple Finesse (on blue 1 + blue 2 + blue 3 into blue 4) or it could be a Bluff (on just blue 1 into red 4).However, this must be a Bluff, because 1 does not match 4. So Cathy should think that she has the one-away-from-playable 4, the red 4.The point of this example is to show that because a 2 happens to be played on the stacks, the blue 4 is a one-away-from-playable card and therefore becomes a legal Bluff target. Example 5 (rank mismatch where a Bluff is impossible): This is a 4-player game.Nothing is played on the stacks.Alice clues Donald number 4, touching a 4 as a Play Clue.Bob blind-plays the red 1.Cathy discards.Donald needs to evaluate whether or not Alice's clue is a Finesse or a Bluff. However, he knows that it cannot be a Bluff, because there are no one-away-from-playable 4's. So even though 1 does not match 4, this must be a Finesse, because Alice is not allowed to perform a Bluff with any card that she wants.Donald does not see any other red cards in Bob's hand. So Donald should think that he has the red 4, because that would match the blind-play of a red 1. Subsequently, Donald must have red 2 on his Finesse Position and red 3 on his Second Finesse Position. Example 6 (rank match where a Finesse is impossible): Red 2 and blue 2 is played on the stacks.Alice clues Cathy number 4, touching a 4 as a Play Clue.Bob blind-plays the blue 3.Normally, Cathy would think that this is a Finesse, because 3 matches 4, meaning that Cathy's 4 is the blue 4.However, Cathy notices that her 4 has a negative blue clue on it. Thus, it cannot be the blue 4.This must instead be a Bluff. Cathy marks her 4 as the red 4 (since red 4 is the only other one-away-from-playable 4).

Instead, it is a blue 2 and it successfully plays.From Cathy's perspective, she knows that the red 4 is two-away-from-playable instead of one-away-from-playable. Bluffs on two-away-from-playable cards are normally illegal. Thus, Cathy's mystery 3 must be exactly red 3, making the red 4 one-away-from-playable after all.Cathy discards.From Donald's perspective, since red (the type of clue that was given) does not match blue (the card that was blind-played), this must be a Bluff. Normally, since the red 1 is currently played on the stacks, Donald would think that he has the red 3 (e.g. the one-away-from-playable red card).However, Cathy already has a clued red 3 in her hand. If Donald also had a red 3, then Alice's clue would be violating Good Touch Principle. Thus, Donald must have the red 4 instead.

In this case, Bob knows that Alice is \"guiding\" him and he does not have to worry about Cathy's chop card. If Alice needs Bob to save Cathy's chop card, then Alice would wait until later to perform the Finesse or Bluff.For example, in a 3-player game: No cards are played on the stacks.Alice clues red to Donald, touching a red 2 as a Play Clue.Bob does not see any red 1's in anyone else's hand.

In this situation, we would say that Bob is the reacting player. If a reacting player does not \"react\" to a clue in some demonstrable way, then someone else on the team will go on to misplay a card. So, the reacting player has to immediately decide what the clue means and perform the resulting action. In some situations, there can be two reacting players in a row. For example, if Alice clues a two-away-from-playable card, then Bob must react and Cathy must react. So how does a reacting player figure out what the clue means? They should use Occam's Razor - always assume the simplest possible interpretation. 1) Assume a direct Play Clue or a Delayed Play Clue (if it could be possible that no Prompts & no blind-plays are involved). 2) Assume a Prompt (if it could be possible that no blind-plays are involved). 3) Assume a Finesse (or a Prompt + Finesse) over a Bluff. 4) Assume the \"move\" that results in the least number of blind-plays. - In general, this means assuming a one-blind-play *Bluff* over a two-blind-play *Finesse*.

One 2 has been played already, so from Cathy's perspective, each 2 has a 1/4 chance of being the blue 2.Thus, it is Bob's responsibility to save the blue 2.

For example, in a 4-player game: Nothing is played on the stacks.Alice clues Donald about a red 2 as a Play Clue.Both Bob and Cathy have red 1 on their Finesse Position.Bob will think that it is a Finesse directed at Cathy, and he will discard.Next, Cathy thinks that Bob made a mistake and \"missed\" the Finesse. Cathy discards. Here, Cathy is actually the one making the mistake. It follows from High-Value Principle that you should never assume that your teammates are making a mistake. If Bob is discarding, then it means that Cathy also has the exact same copy of the card, and Cathy should immediately blind-play. "},{"title":"The Ambiguous Finesse Pass-Back","type":1,"pageTitle":"Level 9 - Fellow","url":"docs/level_9#the-ambiguous-finesse-pass-back","content":"When an Ambiguous Finesse occurs, the first player will not play into the Finesse, and do something unrelated. At that point, it is usually clear that another player on the team also has the matching card. That other player should then immediately blind-play, resolving the Ambiguous Finesse as fast as possible.However, in some specific situations, the second person cannot blind-play the card, or else a misplay would occur. In these situations, the second person has to also not play into the Finesse. This \"passes\" the blind-play back to the first person again.For example, in a 4-player game: Blue 1 is played on the stacks.Alice clues blue to Donald, touching a blue 4 as a Play Clue.Bob sees that Cathy has the blue 2 on her Finesse Position. From his position, this must be a Double Finesse, with Cathy blind-playing the blue 2, and Bob blind-playing the blue 3 from his own Finesse Position. Bob discards.Cathy sees that Bob has the blue 2 on his Finesse Position and the blue 3 on his Second Finesse Position.Cathy also knows that the only reason that Bob would discard is if Cathy also had the blue 2 on her Finesse Position. Thus, Bob expects her to blind-play on this turn, and this is an Ambiguous Finesse.Normally, Cathy would blind-play the blue 2 herself. However, in this situation, if she blind-plays the blue 2, then Bob would go on to misplay the other blue 2, thinking that it is blue 3.Thus, Cathy must pretend like the Finesse is not on her after all, and force Bob to be the one to blind-play first. Cathy discards her chop card, passing the Finesse back to Bob.Donald and Alice discard.Bob knows that Cathy was supposed to blind-play the blue 2, but she didn't. He must also have the blue 2. Furthermore, he must also have the blue 3, as that would be an excellent reason for Cathy to pass the Finesse back to him. Bob will now blind-play blue 2 and blue 3. As a side note, you may be wondering why, in the above example, Cathy does not blind-discard her blue 2 from her Finesse Position instead of discarding her chop. This is because it is possible that Cathy does not have the blue 2 on her Finesse Position and instead has some other unrelated playable card as a Layered Finesse. Thus, Cathy must play it safe and discard her chop.

For example, by discarding specific trash cards, it can communicate that the player \"sees\" all of the non-trash possibilities of that card. "},{"title":"The 3 Bluff","type":1,"pageTitle":"Level 9 - Fellow","url":"docs/level_9#the-3-bluff","content":"Typically, the player who receives a clue that causes a Bluff blind-play knows that the card that was clued is one-away from being playable.Our group plays with an artificial 3 Bluffs convention. This means that in addition to being one-away from being playable, we agree that the touched card can also be any 3 that will be useful in the future.3 Bluffs are mostly used to get 1's played at the beginning of the game. However, similar to a normal Bluff, a 3 Bluff can be used to get any playable card (as long as it doesn't look like a Finesse, obviously.)Here are some examples that cover the four most common 3 Bluff situations: Example 1 - Color Mismatch (Valid)# On the first turn of the game, Alice clues Cathy red, which touches a red 3.Bob blind-plays blue 1.Cathy knows that it is either a red 2 (if it was a normal Bluff) or a red 3 (if it was a 3 Bluff). She marks down both of the possibilities for later. Example 2 - Number 3 with Suit Mismatch (Valid)# On the first turn of the game, Alice clues Cathy number 3, which touches a red 3.Bob blind-plays blue 1.Cathy knows that it was a 3 Bluff, because a played 1 does not \"match\" number 3.Beyond that, Cathy knows nothing about the card, besides that it is a 3 (since it has a number 3 clue on it). Example 3 - Color Match (NOT valid; looks like a Finesse)# On the first turn of the game, Alice clues Cathy red, which touches a red 3.Bob blind-plays red 1.Cathy sees that Bob does not have red 2. Since red matches red, Cathy assumes that she has the red 2.Cathy misplays red 3 as red 2.Alternatively, if Cathy saw that Bob had both red 1 and red 2 on his Finesse Position at the time the clue was given, she would know that she has the red 2 or the red 3. Subsequently, Bob is promised a red 2, since if he does not blind-play a card, Cathy will go on to misplay the red 3 as red 2. Example 4 - Color Match with Rank Mismatch (NOT valid; looks like a Finesse):# This is a 4-player game.Nothing is played on the stacks.Alice clues Donald red, touching a red 3 as a play clue.Bob blind-plays the red 1.Cathy notices that Donald's red card has a negative 2 clue on it. This means that Donald will not go on to misplay the card as the red 2.Cathy needs to evaluate whether or not Alice's clue is a Finesse or a 3 Bluff. If this is a Double Finesse, then Cathy needs to blind-play the red 2. If this is a Bluff, then Alice only intended for Bob to blind-play.Cathy knows that since red matches red, this must be a Double Finesse, so Cathy blind-plays the red 2 into the red 3. Example 5 - Number 3 with Suit Match (valid)# On the first turn of the game, Alice clues Cathy number 3, which touches a red 3.Bob blind-plays red 1.Cathy knows that it was a 3 Bluff, because a played 1 does not \"match\" number 3.Beyond that, Cathy knows nothing about the card, besides that it is a 3 (since it has a number 3 clue on it).Even though red 1 and red 3 are the same suit, Bob is not promised a red 2, because if he does nothing, Cathy will not go on to misplay the red 3. Generic Questions# 3 Bluffs can be confusing. If you don't want to memorize the five examples above, you can simply ask the following questions: 1) Does the clue \"match\" the blind-play? If it matches, then it is a Finesse. If it does not match, then it is a Bluff. Red matches red, but red does not match blue. 2 matches 3, but 1 does not match 3. 2) Will the player who received the clue go on to misplay if nothing else is blind-played? If yes, then it is a Finesse. If no, then it is a Bluff. "},{"title":"The Critical 4 Bluff","type":1,"pageTitle":"Level 9 - Fellow","url":"docs/level_9#the-critical-4-bluff","content":"Building on the 3 Bluffs convention, we also agree that it is possible for a card that initiates a Bluff to be a copy of any of the 4s that are currently in the discard pile, but only if a color clue is used.For example, in a 3-player game: Nothing is played on the stacks. Red 4 is currently in the discard pile.Alice clues Cathy red, touching a red 4 as a Play Clue.Bob blind-plays a blue 1.Cathy marks her red card as the one-away-from-playable red card, the red 2.However, Cathy also knows that 3 Bluffs are a thing, so she also marks her red card as possibly a red 3.However, Cathy also knows that Critical 4 Bluffs are a thing, so she also marks her red card as possibly a red 4. "},{"title":"Context Clues & The Stale 1's Clue","type":1,"pageTitle":"Level 9 - Fellow","url":"docs/level_9#context-clues--the-stale-1s-clue","content":"We have many conventions that specify what a clue means. But combined with this, we are always expected to look at the context of the game.For example, sometimes players will receive a clue that just feels strange. If this good clue could have been given a bunch of turns ago, why is it only being given now? Were the other players not paying close enough attention, and are only getting around to cluing this card now?In these types of situations, from High Value Principle, you can assume that the team is not making any mistakes, which means that the meaning of the clue should be altered from the \"textbook\" definition. We call these types of clues Context Clues because they rely on contextual reading of the game state.The most common Context Clue is given to \"stale\" 1's towards the beginning of the game. For example, in a 3-player game: After a few ordinary clues happen, Alice discards, which ends the Early Game and initiates the Mid-Game. By doing this, she implies that there is nothing to do (because players are mandated to \"extinguish\" all of the available Play Clues and Save Clues in the Early Game).Bob then immediately clues Cathy about two 1's.Normally, from Good Touch Principle, Cathy would assume that both of the 1's were \"good\" and play both.However, Cathy also knows that if both of these 1's were good, then Alice was required to clue them before discarding.Thus, Cathy can reason that one of the 1's are bad. Furthermore, by convention, she knows that the oldest (right-most) 1 is bad, because that would be the one that she would ordinarily play first.So, Cathy should skip over the oldest (right-most) 1, and play the other 1. Cathy should also treat the other 1 as known-trash. The Stale 1's Clue is specific example of a more general concept called Focus Inversion, which is covered later. "},{"title":"Focus Inversion","type":1,"pageTitle":"Level 9 - Fellow","url":"docs/level_9#focus-inversion","content":"Sometimes, a Play Clue is given that both touches the chop card and one or more other card. The normal interpretation of this is to treat it as a chop-focus Play Clue, and play the chop. However, sometimes a player can know that the chop is not actually playable. This can be determined through: explicit information - negative clues present on the cardimplicit information - historical / contextual information about the card derived from moves that teammates performed earlier on in the game When this occurs, the clue is meant to be a Play Clue on the left-most card instead of the chop card.Just like a \"normal\" Play Clue that touches multiple new cards, the chop card (and other new cards introduced) are not necessarily playable right now.For example, in a 3-player game: Alice clues 1's to Bob, which introduces one card on slot 1.Bob plays the 1 and it is red 1.Cathy clues blue to Bob, which introduces two cards on slot 1 and slot 5.Normally, Bob would think that this is a Chop-Focus clue, and play the blue 1 from slot 5.However, his slot 5 card has a negative 1 clue on it (from Alice's number 1 clue), so it explicitly cannot be the blue 1.Thus, this must be Focus Inversion and blue 1 must be on slot 1. The blue card on slot 5 can be either blue 2, blue 3, blue 4, or blue 5. Note that Self-Finesses with rank always take precedence over Focus Inversion. (Self-Finesses with rank are quite common, but Self Finesses with color are nonsensical.)

In this situation, if a player discarded their chop card as a Positional Discard, this would not work, because discarding chop is the normal action that the rest of the team is expecting.Thus, in order to more strongly communicate the \"play this slot\" message, they can instead misplay their chop card.

And this type of clue is normally pretty good. But because of the previous considerations, sometimes it would be better to get the 1's with several color clues instead. Example 1# Players should not just consider how good their individual clue is - they should also consider how their teammates can build on top of their clue.For example, in a 3-player game: It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.Bob's hand is as follows, from newest to oldest: green 4, red 1, red 3, blue 2, blue 1Alice would like to get the red 1 and the blue 1 played from Bob's hand. (No-one else has a red 1 or a blue 1.) Should Alice clue number 1, red, or blue?If Alice clues number 1, it would be a 2-for-1 clue. But then the team will probably spend a clue getting the blue 2. This will result in an efficiency of 3-for-2. And the red 3 will probably end up being discarded. Bad.If Alice clues blue, it would be a 2-for-1 clue. But then the team will no longer be able to give a red clue, because it would be Chop-Focused on the red 3. So they would have to clue number 1, which would result in an efficiency of 3-for-2. Bad.Thus, Alice should clue red first, and then clue blue later, resulting in an efficiency of 4-for-2. Example 2# When players make the choice between cluing number 1 or cluing color, the cards in other people's hands should also be considered.For example, in a 4-player game: It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.Cathy's hand is as follows, from newest to oldest: red 1, green 4, blue 3, blue 1Donald is holding a cluable red 2.Alice would like to get the red 1 and the blue 1 played. (No-one else has a red 1 or a blue 1.) Should she clue 1, red, or blue?Just like in the previous example, cluing number 1 means that the red 2 will have to be clued as a 1-for-1, which results in an efficiency of 3-for-2.Instead, Alice clues red to Donald, performing the Finesse as a 2-for-1. Next, Bob clues blues to Cathy as a 2-for-1. In total, this is a 4-for-2. Example 3# As explained in the beginner's guide, it is almost always better to give a Play Clue instead of a Save Clue if a player has a playable card in their hand.However, building on the theme of having teammates \"build\" on your clues, sometimes it is better to give a Save Clue first and then a Play Clue later.For example, in a 3-player game: It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.Cathy's hand is as follows, from newest to oldest: blue 4, blue 4, red 3, red 1, blue 5Alice would like to get the red 1 played. (No-one else has a red 1 in their hand.) Alice also knows that the team needs to eventually save the red 5.If Alice clues number 1 first to get the red 1, then the team will need to give a 5 Save to save the blue 5, resulting in an efficiency of 2-for-2.Instead, Alice clues number 5 as a 5 Save, which allows Bob to follow up with a red Chop-Focus Play Clue. This touches the red 3 as a 2-for-1, allowing for an overall efficiency of a 3-for-2. Other Considerations# Just in case you thought Hanabi was not difficult enough, there are some other factors to consider when finding the best clue: Does giving a color clue put a playable card on Finesse Position? If so, maybe a color clue is better.Does giving a number 1 clue give the player the ability to perform a useful Order Chop Move? If so, maybe a number 1 clue is better.Are there other ways to touch the extra cards from a color clue? If so, maybe a number 1 clue is better.

By blind-playing it, they can show that a Bluff is happening.In a normal Bluff, the player receiving the clue would think that it is a one-away from playable card. In this case, if it was a normal Bluff, they would think that they have the black 2.However, as noted above, in this situation black 2's on chop are allowed to be touched as a Save Clue. So, touching a black 2 in this way would not cause a blind-play. Thus, by convention, the card should be black 1, and they can play it.It is also possible to use this convention to perform a Black Save Bluff on cards other than the black 1. For example, in a 3-player game: All of the 1's are played on the stacks.Cathy has a black 3 on slot 3 and a black 2 on slot 5. (The black 2 is on chop.)Cathy has no other 2's in her hand, so a number 2 clue is available for Alice to use and would clearly communicate a Play Clue on the black 2 (since all of the 2's are currently playable).Alice clues black to Cathy.Bob knows that this will be treated as either a black 3 or a black 4 save, and the black 2 will never play.Bob also sees that there is nothing special going on.There must be a reason for this bad clue, so Bob knows that this is the Black Save Bluff, and he blind-plays his slot 1.

Muddy rainbow has a similar convention.When one or more muddy rainbow cards are retouched with a color clue, and there are no \"new\" cards introduced (or, if the only \"new\" cards introduced are trash), then extra information can be conveyed by what color is chosen. The color chosen should correspond to the slot that they should play.This is called a Muddy Rainbow Choice Tempo Clue, or just a Mud Clue for short.The slot number is calculated in roughly the same way that Null Color Positional Clues are calculated. In short, the slot number corresponds to the ordering of the colors from right to left. But skip the cards that are not touched by the color clue (and the known unplayable cards). Furthermore, colors always \"wrap around\" to the oldest card.For example, in a 3-player game of the \"Muddy Rainbow (6 Suits)\" variant: All of the 2's are played on the stacks.Bob has two muddy rainbow cards clued in his hand on slot 3 and slot 4.

It successfully plays on the stacks. Similar to how Tempo Clues work with pink cards and brown cards, Tempo Clues on muddy rainbow cards are never Tempo Clue Chop Moves or Double Tempo Clues - they only promise the one card and that's it.Muddy Rainbow Choice Tempo Clues are only allowed to get muddy rainbow cards. An exception to this rule can be made for extremely difficult variants. If the team needs to get a non-muddy card for some specific purpose (e.g. to \"unlock\" another player), and there was not another good way to \"get\" the card, then it should be clear to everyone what is happening.

For example, a number 3 clue equals slot 3.In a 4-player, 5-player game, or 6-player game a number 5 clue equals Chop Move (since there is no slot 5 card). A color positional clue corresponds to a slot number that is based on the order of the stacks. Stacks correspond to the slot numbers from right to left. For example, in a 3-player game of the Null (6 Suit) variant, there are 5 color clues and 5 slots in the hand. Thus, a purple clue equals slot 5 (since it is the right-most color), a blue clue equals slot 4 (since it is the 2nd right-most color), and so forth.More examples for Color Positional Clues are listed below in a separate section. (Color Positional Clues have a dedicated section since they are a bit more complicated.) 2) How do you perform a Positional Clue?# Any \"nonsense\" clue (e.g. a clue that has no normal conventional interpretation) is to be interpreted as a Positional Clue instead.Furthermore, in order to make it easier to perform Positional Clues, we also \"turn off\" the following conventions: a Double Finesse or a Triple Finesse where one player has to blind-play two or more cardsa Double Bluff or a Triple Bluffan Ejection or a Dischargea Rank Choice Finesse or a Rank Choice Bluffa Self Color Bluffa 5 Pull or a Trash Pulla Trash Pusha Black 4 Bluff (with black)a Finesse or Bluff that was initiated with a rank clue when a Free Choice was available between rank and color Any clue that looks like one of these conventions is to be interpreted as a Positional Clue instead: 3) Are Positional Clues a Save Clue or a Play Clue?# A Positional Clue can be either a Save Clue or a Play Clue: If the slot corresponds to the chop of a player, then they have to respect that it could be a Save Clue. In other words, it could be a 2 Save on a null 2, a 5 Save on a null 5, or a save on a critical null 3 or null 4 (if the other copy is in the trash).If the slot corresponds to a slot that is not on the chop, then it is a Play Clue.However, Loaded Play Clues always apply to Positional Clues, even in the Early Game. (This means that you cannot ever give a Positional Save Clue to a player that has one or more known-playable cards.) 4) What about if all the Null cards are already played?# Positional Clues are \"turned off\" once all of the null cards have been played. Once that happens, Double Finesses, Ejections, and so forth are turned back on. 5) Do I discard cards touched as a Positional Clue?# Good Touch Principle applies to cards touched with a Positional Clue in the same way that normal clues are.Thus, if a trash card is used as part of a Positional Clue, then a Fix Clue must be given to the trash card later on. 6) How about an example?# For example, in a 3-player null game: On the first turn of the game, Alice clues Cathy about one 4.Bob knows that normally, this would be a 4's Double Bluff. But Double Bluffs are turned off in variants with a null suit.Bob instead knows that this is a Positional Clue, indicating that someone should play their slot 4 card.Bob sees that Cathy's slot 4 card is not a null card, so he plays his slot 4 card as the null 1. 7) Do you have to be in Bluff Seat to give a Positional Clue?# Yes. You are only allowed to give a Positional Clue to the very next player.The only exceptions is when it is an extraordinary situation or it is very obvious to the team what is going on.  "},{"title":"Color Positional Clues","type":1,"pageTitle":"Specific Conventions for Null","url":"docs/variant_specific/null#color-positional-clues","content":"A color positional clue corresponds to a slot number that is based on the order of the stacks. Stacks correspond to the slot numbers from right to left. For example, in a 3-player game of the Null (6 Suit) variant, there are 5 color clues and 5 slots in the hand. Thus, a purple clue equals slot 5 (since it is the right-most color), a blue clue equals slot 4 (since it is the 2nd right-most color), and so forth.For example, in a 3-player game of the Null (5 Suit) variant, there are 4 color clues and 5 slots in the hand. Thus, a blue clue equals slot 5 (since it is the right-most color), a green clue equals slot 4 (since it is the 2nd right-most color), and so forth. Color Positional Clues Skip Over Clued Cards# When players are determining which slot number the Color Positional Clue is talking about, they should always skip over any cards that have one or more positive clues on them.For example, in a 3-player game of the \"Null (5 Suits)\" variant: All the 1's are played on the stacks except for the null 1.Bob hand is as follows, from newest to oldest: red 1, red 1, null 1, blue 1, blue 5Bob's blue 5 has a number 5 clue on it. (It was clued with a 5 Save earlier on.)Alice clues green to Cathy, touching a green 1.Bob knows that normally, this would be an Unknown Trash Discharge. But all Discharges are \"turned off\" in null variants. Instead, this must be a Null Positional Clue.Bob knows that if his hand was completely unclued, green would refer to slot 4, since there are 5 slots in the hand and green is the 2nd rightmost color. But since Bob's slot 5 card already has a clue on it, he should skip over that card. So this must be targeting his slot 3 (e.g. his 2nd rightmost unclued slot).Bob blind-plays null 1 from slot 3. Color Positional Clues Wrap Around# Color Positional Clues always \"wrap around\" to the oldest card. In other words, if they go \"past\" slot 1, then they would apply to slot 5 again.For example, in a 3-player game of the \"Null (5 Suits)\" variant: All the 1's are played on the stacks except for the null 1.Bob hand is as follows, from newest to oldest: null 1, red 1, red 5, blue 5, green 5All of Bob's 5's have a number 5 clue on them.

Instead, this must be a Null Positional Clue.Bob knows that if his hand was completely unclued, red would refer to slot 2, since there are 5 slots in the hand and red is the 4th rightmost color. But since Bob's slot 3, slot 4, and slot 5 card already have a clue on it, he should skip over those cards.This means that blue would target slot 2 and green would target slot 1. Yellow would target slot 2 again (because of the wraparound) and red would target slot 1.Bob blind-plays null 1 from slot 1. One-of-Each Colors Are Skipped# One-of-each colors are skipped over when finding the \"rightmost color\". This is because the right-most color is the most important color, and one-of-each colors are less likely to be around.For example, in a 3-player game of the \"Black & Null (6 Suits)\" variant: Everyone has 5 cards in their hand.There are 5 possible colors: red, yellow, green, blue, and black.Normally, the rightmost color would be black, meaning that black would be assigned to slot 5. But black is skipped over, so blue is assigned to slot 5.Subsequently, green is assigned to slot 4, yellow is assigned to slot 3, and red is assigned to slot 2.Black is then assigned to slot 1.
